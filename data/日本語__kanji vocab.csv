大人,adult,NOUN,おとな,これは、大人のりょうきんです。,This is the adult price.,大人は三人だけです。,There are only three adults.,大人たちはいざかやにいった。,Some of the adults went to an izakaya.,"This kanji combines big and person. If you're a child, how do you think of adults? You just think of them like big people. That's why this combination of kanji means adult.","""I'm an adult, which means I have adult responsibilities. Oh, Toner (おとな)? I need some of that for my terrible printer..."" ... now feel so sad you have such a terrible printer that runs out of toner every day. Ohhhh Toner!",ウꜜシ *** オトナ *** タイジン *** ダイニン,level1 vocab
一人,"alone, one person",NOUN,ひとり,一人でカラオケにいきました。,I went to karaoke alone.,一人はアメリカ人です。,One of them is American.,むすめは、きょうはじめて一人でおつかいにいきました。,My daughter did the errands by herself for the first time today.,"When there's one person, what are they? Well, they're either just going to be simply one person or alone.","The reading for this vocab doesn't follow any rules you learned previously. It's an exception, which means you have to learn the reading separately too. Spend a few moments trying to remember this word, look away for 10 seconds, and then try to recall its reading. Could you do it? Try again, this time in thirty seconds. Did you do it again? Okay, go ahead and move on. You may know it now, though you'll need to recall it again in the next 5-10 minutes if you want to remember it for good. Alternatively, if you know the reading for the vocab word 一つ (in the same level as this word), you can know that it uses the same reading!",イチꜜニン *** ヒトꜜリ,level1 vocab
アメリカ人,american,NOUN,あめりかじん,おれはアメリカ人か？,Am I American?,アメリカ人が二人います。,There are two American people.,アメリカ人の女とともだちになった。,I made friends with an American girl.,"The アメリカ part is pretty easy so long as you know katakana. It's the word for ""America."" You know that 人 means ""person,"" so you can figure out that America + Person = American.","Often times when two kanji come together to form a combo kanji you use the on'yomi readings. This is similar to that, though instead of another kanji it's a foreign word. So, the reading of 人 is the on'yomi reading じん, which you learned already in the kanji. This pattern works with almost any location as well. Just add a country name + 人 and you've described the people who live there. You'll see more of these before you're finished here.",アメリカꜜジン,level1 vocab
人工,"artificial, man made",NOUN AND NO ADJECTIVE,じんこう,あなたののうは、ほんとうに人工ののうなんですか？,Is your brain really artificial?,この川は、人工の川です。,This river is man-made.,にわに人工しばをしいてみました。,I put artificial turf in the garden.,"A person of industry makes a lot of things by hand, so everything they make is artificial, and also means it's man made.",This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.,ジンコー,level1 vocab
大きい,"big, large",I ADJECTIVE,おおきい,このぼうしは大きすぎます。,This hat is too big.,その大きいももを二つください。,Can I get those two big peaches?,わたしのあかちゃんは、こうしとおなじくらい大きい。,My baby is about as big as a calf.,"This is the adjective form of the kanji 大 (big). It has the same meaning, though it is a word for describing. Words that end with い are often adjectives, remember that for future words as well. So, as long as you know the meaning of this kanji, you can transfer that to the meaning of this word. It's the adjective big / large.","What do you do when you see something really, really big? You say おお because you can't believe your eyes. Imagine something really large and say おお out loud to help seal the memory in that brain of yours.",オーキꜜイ,level1 vocab
大した,"considerable, great",ADJECTIVE,たいした,それは大したことはない。,It’s not a big deal.,まったく大した女だよ。,She is such a great woman.,マクドナルドのしゃちょうになれれば大したものだ。,Being the president of McDonald’s would be a big deal.,"した is the past tense form of する (which means ""to do""). So, essentially this word is ""did big."" What is something that ""did big""? It's something that's considerable or great.","The reading for the 大 part is actually the on'yomi reading you learned when learning its kanji. So, as long as you remember that (and remember to use that reading), you can read this word as well. 大した = たいした.",タꜜイシタ,level1 vocab
下,"down, below",NOUN,した,つくえの下にはなにがありますか。,What’s under the desk?,下に下りてきてください。,Please come down.,ぼくはTofuguオフィスの下のかいにすんでいる。,I live on the floor below the Tofugu office.,"When a vocab is a single kanji with no okurigana (that's hiragana attached to the kanji) it tends to steal the meaning of the kanji it comes from. So, this one is below or down.","When a vocab is a single kanji and is alone it tends to use the kun'yomi reading. You learned the on'yomi reading for this kanji, so now it's time to learn the kun'yomi reading to learn this vocabulary word. What's below you? What's below your foot? Oh no.

Are you sure it’s eight o’clock?,When a vocab is a single kanji it usually steals its meaning from its kanji as well. Same goes for this vocab word. It means eight.,"When a vocab is a single kanji and all alone like this, it's usually going to use the kun'yomi. But, because this is a number (exception) it uses the on'yomi instead, meaning you already know the reading from when you learned the kanji!",ハチꜜ,level1 vocab
八つ,eight things,NUMERAL,やっつ,ふくろには、じゃがいもが八つ入っています。,There are eight potatoes in a bag.,八つしかありませんよ。,There are only eight of them.,八つのかおと六つのうでがあるもの、なーんだ。,What has eight faces and six arms?,"This word follows the ""number of things"" pattern where there's a kanji for a number plus つ on the end. Whenever you see this, you know the word means ""____ things."" Knowing that, as long as you know the kanji (which you do) you can figure out what number of things it is. For this one, it's the kanji for eight plus つ. So, this one is eight things.","Since all of the ""number of things"" words all follow the same pattern (number plus つ), you really just have to remember the part before the つ (and then remember that the つ is in all of these). All of the readings are the kun'yomi reading, which means we'll have to use a mnemonic to remember them (you know the on'yomi reading of the kanji portion). So what eight things do you have? You have eight yachts (やっつ). Go ahead and count them. They're beautiful. Also, be sure not to be confused by this particular reading mnemonic. It includes the つ, even though the つ is outside the reading you need to learn (just makes things easier for you overall). Since you can see the つ outside, it shouldn't be too difficult for you.",ヤツꜜ *** ヤッツꜜ *** ヤッツ,level1 vocab
入り口,entrance,NOUN,いりぐち,入り口のところでまっています。,I will wait for you at the entrance.,入り口が三つあります。,There are three entrances.,入り口にジョニーデップがいるよ。,Johnny Depp is at the entrance.,A mouth that you enter is an entrance.,"Because there's some okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) attached, you can bet that 入り will be a kun'yomi reading. This reading comes from the word 入れる. If you know that word already, this one will be easy. If not, then you'll have to think that the entrance you're going in is eerie (いり). Then, because this word is really two separate words put together to form one word, you can guess that 口 also uses the kun'yomi reading, though the く in くち changes to ぐ due to something called rendaku. Just remember that it's ぐち and not くち here.",イリク°チ *** イリクチ *** ハイリꜜク°チ,level1 vocab
フランス人,frenchman,NOUN,ふらんすじん,フランス人のゆうじんができました。,I made a French friend.,二人はアメリカ人で、あとの三人はフランス人です。,Two of them are American and the other three are French.,とてもセクシーなフランス人シェフにあった。,I met a very sexy French chef.,"フランス is ""France."" So what is a ""France person?"" That would be a French Person.","You can treat this word and the 人 kanji on the end like jukugo (combo kanji). Usually, in the case of jukugo, you use the on'yomi reading. So here you'll want to remember to use the on'yomi reading for 人. If you want, you can add 人 to the end of any place name to describe the people that live there!",フランスꜜジン,level1 vocab

So by that you know that this vocab's meaning is mountain.,"When a vocab is a single kanji all alone with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it's usually going to be the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn when you learned the kanji. To remember this word's reading we'll use a mnemonic. What are you doing going up into the mountains? You're hunting for yams (やま). Go ahead, imagine yourself doing just that, climbing up the mountain (it's hard work!) and then digging in the ground with your hands, then pulling up that sweet, delicious yam! Mmm!",ヤマꜜ,level1 vocab
口,mouth,NOUN,くち,口にソースがついていますよ。,There is some sauce on your mouth.,これを口に入れてください。,Please put this in your mouth.,きのうから口がとじられない。,I haven’t been able to close my mouth since yesterday.,"When a vocab is made up of a single kanji with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it's generally going to have the same meaning as the kanji it came from. From that, you know this word's meaning is mouth.","When a vocab is made up of a single kanji with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it's generally going to use the kun'yomi reading, which you did not learn from learning the kanji. To remember this word, you should use a mnemonic. With your mouth, make a ""kuchi kuchi kou"" (くち) sound. Go ahead, make it. Focus on your mouth and try to imagine each shape it makes while zooming in on it. You're talking to a baby, which is why you're making all these ridiculous noises. Also, instead of ""coo"" at the end, you're saying ""kou,"" because that's the reading of the kanji (こう). くちくちこう！くちくちこう！ Sounds like something from Arrested Development, actually.",クチ,level1 vocab
ふじ山,mount fuji,PROPER NOUN,ふじさん,ふじ山に、ごぜん十一じごろつきたいです。,I want to arrive at Mt.

Fuji was covered in white bird poop.,"Just look at this word. What do you think it means? That's right - it's a name (Fuji) plus the kanji for mountain. Put those together, and you have Mount Fuji. In English the ""Mount(ain)"" part comes first. In Japanese, it comes at the end, sort of like the name ender さん, ちゃん, and so on. You can add 山 to the end of any mountain's name too, not just Mount Fuji.","Normally ふじ would be in kanji, but I wanted you to see this kanji use in action since it's more useful than just being used on Mount Fuji. This is treated like a jukugo word (combo kanji word). In the case of jukugo, usually the on'yomi reading is used, meaning you just have to remember the on'yomi reading of 山.

It has a similar meaning to the meaning of the kanji, and you know it's a verb because it ends with an う sound (る, in this case). But, the meaning is to climb. Comparing it to the other 上 verb words, it has the least okurigana (versus 上げる and 上がる). You could remember this and know that the thing you don't want to do the most is ""to climb,"" so that's why it has the least okurigana.","The reading for this word is an exception from all the rules of the 上 vocabulary.

The kanji means below so this means something gets lower, by falling or dropping. For example: Prices get lower or fall. Squirrels come down from trees. See? No direct object here. That's why this verb means to get lower or to fall.","Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading. Let's use a mnemonic to remember the reading of the kanji: You know it means to fall so instead of using a saw (さ) to cut down the tree, you decide to let it come to you. It has to come down all by itself. Picture yourself placing a saw at the foot of a tree then sitting back and waiting for it to drop itself at your knees. (This could actually work, don't you judge my methods!)",サカ°ꜜル,level1 vocab
入れる,to insert,TRANSITIVE VERB AND ICHIDAN VERB,いれる,しかくになにを入れますか。,What will you put in the square?,ここにおりがみを十二まい入れてください。,Please insert twelve pieces of origami paper here.,わたしはハンバーガーをひつぎに入れた。,I put a hamburger into the coffin.,"This is similar to the vocab word 入る (to enter), except in this case, instead of entering you're inserting something. So, it's like you're entering something into something else. You can remember that this one is to insert because it's longer than 入る (はいる/to enter). Why? Because it's more difficult to insert something than it is to enter somewhere, which is why you have more help (the extra kana stuck on the end).","When a vocab is a single kanji plus some okurigana (hiragana stuck on the end of kanji) it's almost always going to be the kun'yomi reading. This is one of two kun'yomi readings you'll be learning for the kanji 入. As long as you know that this vocab means to insert, you can use that to remember the reading as well. When you insert your hand into the mysterious hole, it feels cold and sticky inside. You scream: ""い!"" as an eagle flies out.",イレル,level1 vocab
下げる,to lower,TRANSITIVE VERB AND ICHIDAN VERB,さげる,けつあつを下げるほうほうをおしえてください。,Please tell me how to lower my blood pressure.,あのみせは、入り口にふうりんを一つ下げています。,That shop has one wind chime hanging in its entrance.,きおんを下げるために、あまごいダンスをおどってみた。,I tried to perform a rain dance to lower the temperature.,"This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means below so the verb version of that is when you put something below you. It's to lower something. This is a transitive verb. That means it takes a direct object. You lower something. Like your blood pressure!","Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn with the kanji. Here's a mnemonic to help you: You want to lower a tree so you need a saw (さ). Lower the tree to the ground gently while you slowly saw it down!",サケ°ꜜル,level1 vocab
上げる,to raise,TRANSITIVE VERB AND ICHIDAN VERB,あげる,このはこをれいぞうこの上に上げてください。,Please put this box on top of the refrigerator for me.,三センチ上げてください。,Please raise it three centimeters.,りょうてを上に上げて、大きくおならをした。,I raised my hands and let out a huge fart.,"This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means above so the verb version of that is when you put something above you. It's to raise something. This is a transitive verb. That means it takes a direct object. You raise something. Like your hands!","Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to use the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn with the kanji. Here's a mnemonic to help you: You want to raise an aardvark (あ) above your head. Why? Because even though aardvarks have long tongues, it can't reach the ants in the trees. But when you raise the aardvark it can get at those yummy ants!",アケ°ル,level1 vocab
上がる,to rise,INTRANSITIVE VERB AND GODAN VERB,あがる,どんどんねつが上がっています。,My fever is rising steadily.,三かいまでエレベーターで上がりましょう。,Let's go up to the 3rd floor using the elevator.,けむりが上がってる。,Smoke is rising.,"This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. This is an intransitive verb. That means it does not take a direct object. The kanji means above so this means something rises. For example: A fever rises. The sun rises. See? No direct object here. That's why this verb means to rise or to go up.","Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you can guess that it uses the kun'yomi reading, which also happens to be a reading you didn't learn when you learned the kanji. Let's use a mnemonic for the kun'yomi reading now, though. You have to remember at least the あ part to read it. You know that this word means to rise. Imagine something just rising on its own, like a floating tree or something. What would you say? Probably a ""surprised"" sound. Maybe you'd scream ""あ!"" when you saw this floating tree.",アカ°ル,level1 vocab
二,two,NUMERAL,に,二十一ページの二ばんはクラスでします。,We will work on question two on page twenty-one in class.,わたしのこどもは二さいです。,My child is 2 years old.,わたしのおじは、ねこを二ひきかっています。,My uncle has two cats.,When a vocab word is a single kanji without okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it usually has the same meaning as the kanji it's spawned from. If you know the kanji meaning you'll also know the vocab meaning. It's two!,"When a vocab word is a single kanji with no okurigana, it usually uses the kun'yomi reading. Numbers are an exception to this. Numbers use the on'yomi reading, which you've already learned by learning the kanji's reading! How nice!",ニꜜ,level1 vocab
二人,"two people, pair",NOUN,ふたり,DVDを、あねと二人でみています。,I am watching a DVD with my older sister.,あの二人はいつも二人でくみたがる。,Those two want to be a couple all the time.,かのじょは二人ごろしでたいほされた。,She was arrested for double murder.,"When you have two and person and then put them together, what do you get? You get a pair or two people.","The reading for this word is quite strange. If you know 二つ's reading, you can use that to remember the 二 part (ふた). But, the り that is the 人 is a total exception, something you won't see too often (though you may have seen it in 一人). If you can use the reading of 一人 (aka if you've learned it already) then definitely use that. If not, do your best to remember the reading on your own. It's a strange one that doesn't connect to much else.",フタリꜜ *** フタリ,level1 vocab
二つ,two things,NUMERAL,ふたつ,二つのかいわです。,It’s two dialogues.,このカゴにリンゴを二つ入れてください。,Please put two apples in this basket.,かれの二つめのあくぎょうは、かえるのあんさつだ。,His second evil deed was the frog’s assassination.,"This word follows the ""number of things"" pattern where there's a kanji for a number plus つ on the end. Whenever you see this, you know the word means ""____ things."" Knowing that, as long as you know the kanji (which you do) you can figure out what number of things it is. For this one, it's the kanji for two plus つ. So, this one is two things.","Since all of the ""number of things"" words all follow the same pattern (number plus つ), you really just have to remember the part before the つ (and then remember that the つ is in all of these). All of the readings are the kun'yomi reading, which means we'll have to use a mnemonic to remember them (you know the on'yomi reading of the kanji portion). So what thing do you have two of? The two things that you have consist of one foot and another foot (ふた). Remember from the on'yomi how you had two knees (for the reading に)? Now can move down your leg and look at one foot then another foot.",フタツꜜ *** フタツ,level1 vocab
上,"up, above","ADVERB, NOUN, SUFFIX, AND NO ADJECTIVE",うえ,上のひょうをみてください。,Please look at the chart above.,このフロアの三かい上にトーフグのオフィスがあります。,The Tofugu office is three floors up.,くつ下のかたほうは、かいだんの上にあったわよ。,One of your socks was at the top of the stairs.,"When a vocab word is a single kanji and alone, it tends to steal the meaning from the kanji. Same goes for this one too. It means above or up.","When a vocab word is a single kanji and doesn't have okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it usually will use the kun'yomi. Since you learned the on'yomi reading of the kanji, we'll need to use a mnemonic to learn the reading of this vocabulary word. Above you is a huge weight. You're holding it up and struggling (it's heavy!). You look up and try to crane your neck to see how much it weighs (うえ), but you can't see the numbers on the side of it.

女,woman,NOUN,おんな,この女はだれですか。,Who is that woman?,わたしは女です。,I'm a woman.,おれはこどもをせわする女がほしい。,I want a woman who will help look after my children.,"When a kanji is alone and doesn't have any okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it's usually going to take the same meaning as the kanji it comes from. So in this case, you know that this word means woman.","When a word is a single kanji with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it tends to use a kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn the kun'yomi reading when you learned the kanji itself, so let's use a mnemonic to remember the vocab word. There's a woman in front of you. Who is she? It's just you and her in the store, and you're staring each other down. Oh. It turns out she's the store owner (おんな), which is weird, because you are in a store that makes only manly things.

Why? Probably because the moon takes about a month to get through its cycles. So, what's the fourth moon of the year? Here's a hint, it's the same as the fourth month of the year: April.","The reading for this 四 is different from the one you learned. Instead of よん it's し, the on'yomi reading, which is also fairly common but not as common as よん I'd say (though they're both worth learning, if you can do that right now). You can remember that the word for ""April"" is read using し for 四 because in April, Charlie Sheen (し) did the most horrible April Fools joke on you. Go ahead and imagine what might be, but make it terrible, like feeding you your prize racing horse or something. Also, this is a specific month, so it uses the がつ reading.",シカ°ツꜜ *** シカ°ツ,level2 vocab

What is the adjective version of the kanji 丸? ""Circle"" becomes circular, spherical or round. This, compared to another similar word (円), is more general purpose and can be used with 3D spherical objects as well.","This word uses the reading you learned for the kanji 丸, though you'll need to tack the い onto the end too.",マルイ,level2 vocab

There's no particular reason why this is, but oftentimes a ""body part"" word (like mouth) changes a word to use kun'yomi readings instead of on'yomi ones. You already know the kun'yomi reading for 口 (くち) from learning the vocab, but to remember the reading for 出 you can think the following: If I exit out this mouth, I'll end up in the ocean (you were swallowed by a whale) and I will surely end up dead (で).

Oh wait, that's easy. It's an eyeball!","This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. 目玉, however, is an exception. Perhaps this is because it includes a body part (the eye) in it, which often makes a word switch to kun'yomi readings. Either way, it doesn't matter too much. Both the readings you learned for the kanji in this word are the kun'yomi, meaning you should know how to read this one. Just make sure you watch out for the rendaku.",メダマꜜ,level2 vocab

Well, the 女 part comes before the 王 when it's a queen, because the queen always comes before the princess (they're usually pretty selfish in the stories, right?).

You'll see it from time to time, so take note of it, even though it doesn't really have any meaning of its own. So, essentially 中々 is the same as 中中. That being said, you have something that's middle x2.

This hiragana is の, a particle that makes something possessive. In this case, the 子 is of the 女. Basically, this suggests that the woman is a child, aka a young lady or a girl.","Since there's hiragana in here, you can bet that these kanji will use the kun'yomi readings.

Also, you should know the kun'yomi reading for 口 as well from level 1. That means as long as you remember that this is a kun'yomi fest over here, you should be able to read this word.

That's why you eat it when it's fresh, and that's also when you eat it raw. You'll see this word at the beginning of other words. For example, 生たまご is ""raw egg.""","This uses one of the kun'yomi readings. To remember this one, though, think this: When you get a raw fish in Japan, you never want to name (なま) it, because you'll probably have to eat it (and that would be traumatizing!).

Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. This is an intransitive verb. That means it does not take a direct object. The kanji means cut so this means something is cut. Something breaks or snaps. No direct object here. That's why this verb means to be cut.","Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember the き portion: Something is snapping. Turns out that something is your arm. Your arm is a tree (木, き) that grew out of you one day. ""What's this ki doing here?"" you ask. Then it suddenly breaks in half! ""OW OW OW! My ki! It's been cut!!""",キレꜜル,level3 vocab

Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. This is an intransitive verb. That means it does not take a direct object. The kanji means outside so this is when something goes too far outside and disconnects. Something comes off. No direct object here, see? That's why this verb means to be disconnected or to be out.","You have to remember the はず portion of this word. Think of it this way - you're on your phone and you are disconnected. Why were you disconnected? You look around and see a yellow haze (はず) floating around, melting everyone's phones. Well that's lame. Too bad you can't call anyone to help you get your phone back.",ハズレル,level3 vocab

Oh, it's today.","The reading for this word is a complete exception, though the word itself is incredibly common and useful. When you think of ""today"" think about what you have to do today for work. You have to work in one of those mall kiosks (きょう). Just think about how sad you are that you have to do this today. What a crummy day. It's sunny outside and you're stuck in a mall manning this hermit crab kiosk. Note: This reading mnemonic is pretty far away from the actual reading, as far as reading mnemonics go. Use this to get yourself close, and then use your own brain grapes to get the rest of the way there.

Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means fat so the verb form of that is to get fat.","Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You have to learn the ふと portion of this word to be able to read it. Here's a mnemonic to help you: You're getting fat so quickly that you can see your body expanding.

Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means ""life"" so what is the verb form of that? Would it be ""to do life""? No, probably not. In this case it is to give birth. You'll have to differentiate this one from the word 生まれる as well. You can remember that this one means ""to give birth"" because when you compare, the act of giving birth probably feels shorter than the act of being birthed, at least in terms of sheer terror. The pain of giving birth will make it feel quick, when you look back on it... but just imagine how traumatized the baby must be from going through that as well. So, the act of giving birth is shorter, just like the word itself!","You have to remember the う part of this word to be able to read it. It's the same as 生まれる, so that could help if you've learned that word already. If not, just imagine yourself giving birth, and all you can do is scream: ""UUuUUuuUUuUuu!"" (う).",ウム,level3 vocab

Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means ""life,"" making this word mean ""to live.""","You have to remember the い portion of this word to be able to read it. Think of it this way and you should be able to remember it, though: What does it mean to live?

Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means pull and the verb version vocab means to pull. This word has another meaning! When you pull numbers away from other numbers, what you're really doing is subtracting them. That's why this word also means to subtract.","Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. The reading (ひ) is the same as the one you learned for the kanji, meaning you should already know it!",ヒク,level3 vocab
分ける,to separate,TRANSITIVE VERB AND ICHIDAN VERB,わける,このにくまんを二人で分けましょう。,Let’s split this meat bun between two people.,生しを分けるけつだんになった。,It was a decision that spelt the difference between life and death.,ピザを半分に分けるなら、大きい方を下さい。,"If you split the pizza, could you give me the bigger half?","This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う (in this case る) sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means separate (at least, that's one of its several meanings). So, the verb form of that is to separate. You'll have to differentiate this word with 分かる which is very similar but has a totally different meaning. You'll need to learn the reading to do this, but think of it this way: You must ""separate"" your Wake (わけ) time from your sleeping time.","Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You are to separate a couple of children that really have fun together.

Now, this word refers to when something stops... not when you're doing the action of stopping something. It's stopping on its own (ex ""the car stops."")

You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You come to a stop sign. Careening down the road is a giant toe (と) driving a car.

This particular word is when you're stopping something (i.e. doing the action of stopping it).","Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You need to stop something from moving. Maybe a car... or a door... or a person... whatever you want. To stop this thing, you throw out your toe (と), getting it smashed in the process. Imagine it bleeding and swelling up. How much it hurts!

This word means to understand and the kanji means many things (understand is one of the lower meanings, which is why I didn't include it in the kanji). This word will often be written in kana alone, but it's written in kanji enough that I thought you should learn it. Think about it this way: You have to separate cars (か) into different groups. Why? Because that's the only way to understand their behaviors and culture. All the Hyundais over here... All the Toyotas over there... Now study them to understand.","Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading.
