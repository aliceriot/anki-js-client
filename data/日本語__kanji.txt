Rivers are usually great ways to divide up a country, and states are one way to do it!</i></span><p> "

Come up with something crazy but also something that interests you. Also make yourself believe that you want to know where his dwelling is (aka where he lives) more than anything else in the world.

Someone at the gate checks the time, and makes sure the <font color=""#f0a""><b>interval</b></font> is correct, then waves it through the gate for another circling, where it creates its next interval of time.</span><p> <span class=""text""><i>Hint: Interval is a weird word to remember, but just think of the sun going around the earth and through the gate just like clockwork.

It pulls us in towards it... It obviously wants us to go to a specific <font color=""#f0a""><b>location</b></font> (aka the location where it is).</span><p> <span class=""text""><i>Hint: This is a really, really general kanji meaning which makes it harder to remember via a mnemonic.

This kanji also means <font color=""#f0a""><b>number in a series</b></font>, which is a lot like a turn. For example, you're number 3, so your turn will be number 3.</span><p> <span class=""text""><i>Hint: Go through in your mind the system your farm / village uses for deciding who has to sickle on any given day. It rotates, and it's a turn-based system. So, do you all stand in a line? Is there a calendar? Come up with something interesting, focusing on your turn in the process you come up with. <br> It will be helpful to remember both the 'number in a series' and 'turn' meanings for the vocab coming up in the future.</i></span><p> "

When dead bodies are out in the sun like this, they really begin to decompose. You are wondering who this person is, though. You can't tell because it's fallen apart too much. You look on the coffin. There's a label, but it only says '<font color=""#f0a""><b>someone</b></font>.'</span><p> <span class=""text""><i>Hint: Smell the stench of the decomposing body. Also, feel really curious as to who this person is. It came from somewhere that gives you a reason to believe it's someone you know.

This kanji can also mean <font color=""#f0a""><b>join</b></font> which makes sense. When something suits you well, like a hat or something, it joins together with you quite well too. Join me, my hat! You suit my head well.&nbsp;It just <b><font color=""#f0a"">fit</font></b>s, you know?</span><p> <span class=""text""><i>Hint: Just remember that this 'suit' means 'to suit you' - not the thing you wear, okay!</i></span><p> "

He had to <font color=""#f0a""><b>support</b></font> the weight of the building to make sure it didn't fall on the elementary school.</span><p> <span class=""text""><i>Hint: When you think 'frog' you have to automatically think about this story. Embellish and add to it if you want. Make it more ridiculous. Make it more vivid. Whatever you need to do to remember that Frog = <font color=""#f0a""><b>support</b></font>.</i></span><p> "
