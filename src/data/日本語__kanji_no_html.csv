上,"above, up",じょう,"うえ, あ, のぼ, うわ, かみ","一, ト","Ground, Toe",There's a toe above ground. Look at it.,"Why is this important? There's another kanji with the toe below the ground, and I bet you can guess the meaning of that kanji. So, where's the toe? It's above the ground. Remember, the toe is what's important here (and its location, because you have to find it otherwise they won't be able to sew it back on).","The toe sticking up above the ground is just a little thing... You go up to poke it and then you realize that the toe actually belongs to Joseph (じょう) Stalin. Joe doesn't like people messing with his toes, so you slowly back away.","Joseph Stalin, if you didn't know, has very sensitive toes. He's also very mean. Imagine yourself backing slowly away from Joe as to not incur his mighty wrath.",kanji level1
下,below,"か, げ","した, さが, くだ, お","一, ト","Ground, Toe",There's a toe below ground.,"So, where is the toe now? It's below ground. Imagine yourself digging it out, and thinking... ugh, why does it have to be below ground like this? So irritating. Will I be able to sew it back on in time to save it?","You keep digging for the toe below the ground, and instead of hitting a toe you hit something hard and metallic. You keep digging and digging around it, but it's huge. Turns out, you found yourself a car (か). Keep digging until you unearth the car. Inside, you find the toe you were looking for.","There's another useful on'yomi reading that just isn't useful enough for you to learn now. That reading is げ, but we're only going to worry about that much, much later when you have to learn one or two vocab words that read 下 as げ. That's the problem with really common kanji - too many readings.",kanji level1
大,big,"たい, だい",おお,大,Big,The big radical and the big kanji are exactly the same!,"So, if you know the radical, you know the meaning of this kanji as well.","There's this big guy (that's how you remember the radical, remember?), and he's wearing a huge Tie Dye (たい, だい) shirt. Because he's so huge, the tie dye shirt is also super huge. Everything about him is pretty big, but the tie dye stands out more than anything.","When you look at the big guy in your head, imagine him covered in tie dye head to toe. Think about how ridiculous it looks on him, especially since he's such a big guy. Shirt. Sweatpants. Hat. Shoes... it goes on and on.",kanji level1
八,eight,はち,や,ハ,Fins,"This isn't exactly the same as the fins radical, but it's close. Sometimes this will happen (where we have to use a slightly 'modified radical' version of the original), so it's good to understand that now, early on. In this case, we have fins. How many fins? eight fins. How do you know that? Because you caught four fish with two fins each.","Count the fins out in front of you, all the way from one to eight. It'll help if you actually do this. Now smell each fin, and think 'wow, I have to smell all eight of these?' Yes, you do.","After you count and smell all eight of your fins, it's time to put them away. You open a large hatch (はち) and put them in. This is where you keep your fins, always putting in eight at a time because that's what the boss wants.","You've asked him why you can only put eight fins at a time in the hatch, but he never wants to answer. What could be down in the hole that the hatch covers? Why is there a hatch at all? What's with numbers and hatches being mysterious?",kanji level1
入,enter,にゅう,"はい, い",入,Enter,"The kanji and the radical are the same, so remembering the meaning of this kanji is as simple as making sure you know the radical for enter first! If you know the radical, you know this kanji means enter as well.","Make sure you know those radicals, yo!","Turns out, after you Enter the teepee (you'll remember that the radical is a teepee with a big entrance to it), you're given a new (にゅう) car!","Imagine lights turning on and flashing, and an entire audience inside. You're at a gameshow, and the announcer announces the neeeeew car in his announcey voice. Feel the surprise. Feel the happiness. Feel the excitement. Check the year on the car, too. It's this year! It really is new!",kanji level1
工,"construction, industry","こう, く",-,工,Construction,"The radical is construction, which is part of the construction industry.","Not to mention, construction of buildings and factories leads to all kinds of new industries as well. Think of all the new industries you could build with construction!","To remember the sound こう we use the name こういち. Think of a construction worker. But, instead of thinking of a normal construction worker, think of one that's just wearing suspenders and a hard hat. No shirt. He's a sexy construction worker, in fact. Then, imagine this sexy construction worker as こういち, your favorite Japanese textbook writer, obviously. Boy is he looking sexy.","If you're somehow not attracted to the hunk of a man that this construction worker version of こういち is, that's okay. It's still ridiculous enough to hook a memory into that brain of yours. Make yourself mad over the fact that he's not following construction site regulations (where's his shirt, shoes, and pants?). That's dangerous! Even if you do look that sexy. Hey, put out that cigarette, it's bad for you! On the other hand, say you do really like what you see (you'll probably have to imagine a better looking version of Koichi's face, though). You two make eye contact. He nods as he puts out his cigarette and takes off his construction worker helmet, letting his long Fabio-esque locks flow. You beckon him over. What happens next is up to you and your own imagination. My guess is you have a conversation about kanji and the best ways to learn it.",kanji level1
山,mountain,さん,やま,山,Mountain,The mountain radical and the mountain kanji are the same.,"Make sure you're studying your radicals. If you are, then you're studying your kanji as well!","Think about mountains talking to each other, calling each other by their names and adding the Japanese name-ender san (さん) to each of their names. 'Hello, Everest-san.' 'Oh hi, Fuji-san.'","Be sure to imagine this vividly. The more absurdly you can imagine it, the more likely you are to remember the reading, san.",kanji level1
口,mouth,"こう, く",くち,口,Mouth,The kanji and the radical that look like this are exactly the same. They are both mouth.,As long as you know the radical mouth you know the kanji mouth.,"Whenever we need to remember the sound こう we use the name こういち. You'll become familiar with this name after a while because the reading こう comes up a lot. Think of a mouth (that should be easy). Now, change it into the scariest mouth you can imagine. Perhaps the teeth are a foot long but just as skinny... or, the lips are bleeding and crispy... whatever scares you, think of it. Then, pan back away from the mouth to see whose mouth it is. Turns out it's こういち's mouth. See こういち there with a terrifying mouth. How scary!","Make sure to vividly imagine that disgusting mouth on こういち. He needs some facial upkeep, I think. The scarier you make it for yourself, and the more ridiculous it is, the more likely you're going to remember this reading. So, imagine away!",kanji level1
九,nine,"きゅう, く",ここの,九,Nine,"Nice! This kanji is the same as the radical that looks just like it (down to the meaning, even!). The radical is Nine and the kanji is Nine making the meaning of this kanji really easy to remember as long as you know the radical first.","If you know the radicals nice and well, you'll know this kanji's meaning nice and well too!","Although this kanji has two on'yomi to learn, the pronunciations of those two on'yomi are very similar, and nearly the same thing (making it easier to remember). Let's use the meaning, Nine, to remember the on'yomi as well. Whenever you try to hit on some cute (きゅう, く) guy/girl (your choice) Nine out of ten times they just spit in your face.","Think of the cutest guy or girl you can. It's important to get it in your mind that these people are super cute, and not just 'somebody.' If you have to, think puppies and kittens instead, the ultimate-cute-machine. They just bite you nine out of ten times. And yes, you keep stats, so imagine yourself writing down stats of this every time you try.",kanji level1
一,one,いち,ひと,一,Ground,"Lying on the ground is something that looks just like the ground, the number One. Why is this One lying down? It's been shot by the number two. It's lying there, bleeding out and dying. The number One doesn't have long to live.","To remember the meaning of One, imagine yourself there at the scene of the crime. You grab One in your arms, trying to prop it up, trying to hear its last words. Instead, it just splatters some blood on your face. 'Who did this to you?' you ask. The number One points weakly, and you see number Two running off into an alleyway. He's always been jealous of number One and knows he can be number one now that he's taken the real number one out.","As you're sitting there next to One, holding him up, you start feeling a weird sensation all over your skin. From the wound comes a fine powder (obviously coming from the special bullet used to kill One) that causes the person it touches to get extremely itchy (いち).","Make sure you feel the ridiculously itchy sensation covering your body. It climbs from your hands, where you're holding the number One up, and then goes through your arms, crawls up your neck, goes down your body, and then covers everything. It becomes uncontrollable, and you're scratching everywhere, writhing on the ground. It's so itchy that it's the most painful thing you've ever experienced (you should imagine this vividly, so you remember the reading of this kanji).",kanji level1
人,person,"にん, じん","ひと, と",人,Person,"Do you remember the radical version of this kanji, where you knocked a zombie down breaking it in half, only leaving its legs standing? Then it said 'Hey, I'm a Person too?' Well, that radical is a kanji too, and that kanji is Person.","Know the radicals, and you shall know the kanji.","Only one Person at Nintendo (にん) complained about the new Jeans (じん) policy, and that person was you.","Imagine how angry you were about the policy. You'll have to come up with something to be angry about yourself (pick something that would actually make you angry, like maybe you're only allowed to wear cut off short-shorts jeans at Nintendo now), but if you pick something good, you'll definitely remember the two readings for this. Just remember you're working at Nintendo, and the policy has to be something about jeans. Then, imagine yourself as the only person complaining and everyone else in their dumb jeans (or lack-thereof) shaking their head at you because you're being a fool.",kanji level1
力,power,"りょく, りき",ちから,力,Power,The radical and the meaning of this kanji are the same. Both are Power.,"If you know the radicals, you should be feeling fine... No, you should feel powerful!","Who has the most Power of anyone? It's the Power Rangers. Who are they battling? Ricky the Rock (りき, りょく) Monster.","Know anyone named Ricky (りき), even a famous person like Ricky Ricardo or Ricky Gervais? Put his face on the monster the Power Rangers are fighting. Also, imagine him throwing rocks (りょく) and hitting people with them. You should imagine it as more gruesome than Power Rangers was on the show. This is real, yo (and gruesome will help you to remember).",kanji level1
川,river,かわ　(せん),かわ,川,River,The river radical and the river kanji are the same as each other!,"So, if you know the radical you know the kanji as well.","So you're in a river. As you're floating down, enjoying yourself, you bump into something. It says 'moo' to you. You look around. There are hundreds of cows (かわ) surrounding you.",Touch them as you float by. Smell them. Is the river filled with cow poop? Probably. Use that to help you to remember that you run into cows when you're in the river.,kanji level1
七,seven,しち,なな,七,Seven,"Lucky for you (as is the case with many of the lower-stroke kanji), this kanji is the same as the radical you've already learned. The radical that makes up this kanji is seven and the kanji (which is exactly the same) is also seven. So, if you know the radical, you know the meaning of the kanji as well.",Make sure you know your radicals well and you'll be A-Okay on this one!,"You know this kanji means Seven, so let's use that to remember the reading too. Seven is a lucky number, usually, but this time it wasn't so good. Seven percent is all she got on her test after she cheated (しち) on it.","How unbelievable is it that someone got seven percent on a test, especially if you try to cheat? Imagine the girl you loathe the most from school, and imagine her cheating on the test (it's important it's a girl, because of the 'she' part in she cheated (しち). Then, imagine your happiness when she's super upset about getting seven percent on it. Serves her right, obviously.",kanji level1
十,ten,じゅう,とお,十,Cross,"When you think of crosses, you think of certain religions (Christianity). Instead of thinking about Christianity, though, let's think about where the Christians came from, namely the Jewish faith. How many commandments did they have? They had ten of them.","This kanji is made up entirely of the cross radical, which might be a little confusing since you have to remember two different meanings. If you make a progression of the story in your mind, though, it should be a lot better. So, as long as you think 'Okay, I have a cross ... what have I associated with this cross? Why, the Ten Commandments.' If you do this, you should be alright and you should be able to remember both!","So, now that you have the Ten Commandments in your head, think 'who held up these Ten Commandments?' Why it was Moses, who was a Jew (じゅう).","See how the progression of everything works? If you know the radicals, you can remember the meaning. If you know the meaning, you can remember the reading. It's all about connecting these things to each other in your head, because the more connections you have, the more likely you are to remember! It's just how the brain works.",kanji level1
三,three,さん,み,"一, 二","Ground, Two",This one uses the ground radical (which also happens to be the kanji for 'one') and the radical 'two.' Let's combine those ones together. What do you get? You get three.,"This one should be pretty self explanatory! Even easier, you can look at this kanji and see it has three straight lines. You know what one looks like. You know what two looks like. So... this is three! (Four is not like this, though).","I'm going to count to three, then I'm going to whack you with these three sticks, son (さん).","I think a Southern accent goes well with this meaning mnemonic. You'll want to imagine that you're a boy and your dad has three sticks, ready for some thwacking. Feel a little afraid by this, and sad about three times the pain. The more emotions you can input (like fear) into this mnemonic, the more likely you are to remember it!",kanji level1
二,two,に,ふた,二,Two,"The kanji two and the radical two are the exact same things. Therefore, you know the kanji for two already!","More simply put, you can just know that this kanji is the double of One. It's two lines, that's not all that hard to remember!","Think of all the things you have Two of. What is the most important? Some would say eyes, some would say ears. I would say the knee (に) because if you didn't have them, it'd be really hard to go up stairs.","Imagine yourself without two knees, and see what it would be like. What would give you trouble? What couldn't you do? Just imagining this for a minute or two will help you to remember the reading of this kanji more effectively.",kanji level1
女,woman,じょ,"おんな, め",女,Woman,The radical for woman and the kanji for woman are exactly the same.,"That means if you know your radicals well, you know the meaning of this kanji as well! How swell.","When you imagine this woman, she has a jo (じょ) weapon. She's standing in a battle stance, and yelling ""I'm the mighty jo fighter woman!""","Be sure to think ""Huh, what a weird lady... Wait, she's gonna hit me with that jo of hers, crap!!""",kanji level1
又,again,また　(kun),また,又,Stool,You're sitting on your stool again!!?,"There's someone you know who carries a stool around with her all the time. Why? Because she's super pregnant and can't walk too far. You're walking with her, but she has to stop every few feet and sit on her stool, again and again. Feel irritated about this, because it will help you to remember the meaning of this kanji better. Imagine this scene taking place several times as you're trying to walk to your destination together, but she's too slow and it's super-duper irritating.","So, she's really pregnant, and carrying a stool, sitting on it again and again. Where are you two going? Where would a super preggers person go? Well, she needs to go to the matanity (また) store to get new clothes for her giant baby stomach.","I know 'mata' and 'maternity' are a bit of a stretch, but the goal is to get you to the memory of また in your head, so they don't necessarily need to be exactly the same. If this can get you to the correct memory in your head, then it does the right thing, and that's good. So, make that your goal and you'll probably remember the reading for this kanji!",kanji level2
玉,ball,たま(ぎょく),たま,"丶, 王","Drop, King",The king has something in his hand that he's dropping... but it bounces too! He's bouncing a ball.,"This kanji looks just like a king bouncing a ball, no? If not, imagine the kanji itself bouncing the drop (the ball) over and over again, then laying some hoops like a pro.",Think of someone curled up in a ball. It is someone you know / someone famous named “Tom” (たま).,"So, who's in a ball? Which 'Tom' did you choose?",kanji level2
本,"book, origin, real, main",ほん,もと,本,Real,"The real radical and the book kanji are the same in looks, but different in meaning. Still, what's the most real thing in the world, besides real life? That would be a book. People put their heart and soul into books, making them as real as they can... that is, unless you read Twilight. There's nothing real about glittery vampires. Take note that the second, third, and fourth meanings of this kanji are origin, real, and main. You can figure this out by thinking about how books almost always have their origin in real life. This in fact is the main source of book materials (real life).","Imagine yourself reading various books... and have them have crazy contents. Constantly think... 'Is it real?' And then decide. Focus in on the fact you're reading a book, especially.","Books are one of the best ways to hone (ほん) your intellect, you know?","A bit weak in the memory department, I know, but run it through your mind a few times. Luckily, you’ll see this on’yomi so much it’ll end up being hard not remembering it, good memory technique or not.",kanji level2
子,child,"し, す",こ,子,Child,The child radical and the child kanji are exactly the same.,"So, if you know your radicals, you know your kanji as well! This won't last forever (where radicals are exactly the same as the kanji) so enjoy it while the kanji are still small and simple!","To remember the sounds し and す we'll use these mnemonics: There's a child. He's walking around, having a good time. Then, all of a sudden out of nowhere, Charlie Sheen (し) jumps out and grabs the child, then runs away with him. That child's parents are definitely going to sue (す) Charlie Sheen (し).","You give chase after him - make sure you zero in on the child, thinking about how you need to save said child. The child is what's important here, because that's the kanji you're learning. Oh, and Charlie Sheen as well, since you have to remember the reading, too. Of course, think about the ridiculousness of the situation. First of all, it's Charlie Sheen. Second of all, he's abducting a child. Third, if he gets away, he's totally getting sued. That's crazy... well... maybe not that crazy.",kanji level2
丸,circle,まる (がん),まる,"丶, 九","Drop, Nine",What's something with nine sides? Just add a drop and you'll have something that's almost a circle.,It's not quite a circle though. You just need to add a drop of liquid to the edges to smooth it out to become a full circle.,"Do you know about the adorable cat Maru? If not, you should check it out. May seem like a distraction, but if you come back knowing the reading for this kanji, then it's totally worth while. When you think about a circle, think about Maru all rolled up in a little circle, being super adorable. Don't tell me it doesn't melt your heart just thinking about it.Alternatively, you could also look at this kanji and think of Maru inside of a box, with her little tail sticking out of it. Whatever works best for you, just get yourself to 'Maru.'","Obviously if you 'don't know this reading' well enough, you should watch some more Maru videos. I'll understand... just make sure you come back someday, okay?",kanji level2
正,correct,"せい, しょう","ただ, まさ","一, 止","Ground, Stop","What ground to a stop, so to speak? You're working on grading tests. But, you run into a question that is wrong, which made you stop. Why? Because you have to correct it.","Go ahead and correct several answers. Feel like you suddenly have to stop whenever you have to correct something. Ugh, how time consuming.","To remember the reading せい we use 'Hard Gay,' because he likes to say 'SEI SEI SEI!' Of course, if you don't know who this Japanese comedian is, you should check him out (literally or figuratively, whatever you want to do is your own business). Here he is helping out a ramen shop. As you're correcting these test answers, someone grabs your pencil and throws your desk to the side. And then they start humping your leg. It's Hard Gay (せい). He tells you that the test you are grading is the shogun's (しょう)! You can't give the shogun a bad grade, he'll have you executed!","Imagine Hard Gay shouting that you can't give the shogun a bad grade. Why is Hard Gay telling you this? You can't seem to figure out why, but with Hard Gay humping your leg it's hard to really concentrate on anything else.",kanji level2
犬,dog,いぬ (けん),いぬ,犬,Dog,The dog radical and dog kanji are exactly the same!,Soon there will be very few kanji/radical-same combos ... so enjoy it while you can.,"You see an emu running towards you from off in the distance (strange to see an emu in these parts...). As it gets closer, you realize that it's not an emu at all, it's something that sounds the same, or similar... an inu!","There's a good chance you know the word for dog in Japanese already too. If so, you're ahead of the game. If not, do your best to learn the reading before moving on.",kanji level2
夕,evening,ゆう　(せき),ゆう,夕,Evening,The evening radical and the evening kanji are exactly the same.,"So, if you know the radical, you know the meaning of this kanji as well. Make sure you know your radicals - they're the building block of everything you learn here!",The evening is when it's time for YOU (ゆう).,"Think about the day, and how it's all about doing things for other people... school, work, etc. But, in the evening, you do what you want, nothing else. Think about what those things might be. Say out loud 'This is for YOU.'",kanji level2
出,exit,しゅつ,"で, だ",山,Mountain,"There are two mountains in front of you... and probably a bunch more around you too. You are in a pass, and don't know how to get out. You are frantically looking for the exit before you freeze to death. The most important thing is to find the exit from this mountain range - your life depends on it.","In your imagination, really feel like your life depends on getting out. The important part is the feeling of 'needing to get out of the mountain pass.' If you have this feeling, you'll be more likely to remember that this kanji means exit, because that's what you want to do when you see this kanji.","As you're trying to exit this mountain range, you suddenly realize that someone is actually hunting you. What? Make sure to feel that sudden realization. It's crazy. Then, you find the exit and run towards it. Sadly, the hunter is waiting there, and he shoots you (しゅつ) through the leg, knocking you down.","Focus on the surprise of realizing you're being hunted while trying to find the exit to the mountain range, then focus on the next part, where you get shot. View it in your head as the hunter shooting you. Powww!",kanji level2
目,eye,め (もく),め,目,Eye,"The eye radical and eye kanji are the same as each other, so now you know them both.","Well... you'll know them both as long as you studied your radicals, young grasshopper. If you didn't, then you're just a young grasshopper who needs to study his/her radicals.","Your eyes are important to you, right? Sadly, one of your eyes is missing right now, because a sheep grabbed it and pulled it out, and is now running away from you, yelling his sheep call.... 'Mehhhhhh (め)!'","Of course, feel the pain of your eye being gone... and struggle to get it back. You eventually give up because the sheep is too fast, but then you come up with an idea. What if I call out back to the sheep in its own language? Go ahead and cover one eye and start making 'MEHHH' noises to see if you can get the sheep to come back to you and give you your eye. It's up to you whether it works or not, but be sure to feel frustrated by its reaction, or happy by it. Either one works.",kanji level2
了,finish,りょう,-,亅,Barb,"Think about it this way. There is a famous fishing lure inventor, working on his best work ever. He’s old, and he’s been trying to make the best fishing lure for the last 50 years, and knows this will be his last invention. Then he figures it out. He takes one barb, and connects the end of it to the top of another barb. When he does this, he knows his work is finally finished.","Make sure you look at this amazing fishing lure too - hold it in your hand, see the two barbs fused together. Think about how strange this lure is. Is this really the best in the world? Will this really finish all other fishing lures?",How does the fish lure maker test his newly finished lure out? The one he just finished? He gets in a row (りょう) boat and rows out into the sea.,"Make him think that he can’t just use his new lure on the side of the lake / ocean / whatever. He has to get out there, but unfortunately all he has is a crappy row boat. Imagine the row boat being terrible, leaky, and dangerous, which is why you’re surprised when he goes for it. That’s a terrible row boat to use! If you do this, you'll focus your mind on the rowboat part of things, which will help you to remember the reading of this kanji.",kanji level2
火,fire,か,"ひ, ほ",火,Fire,The fire and the fire kanji are the same as each other.,If you know the radicals then this one is EZPZ.,"Whenever we need to remember か, we use the word car. For this kanji, when we think fire, we ought to think of something on fire. What is it on fire? It's obviously your very own car (か)! Oh Goddd NOOO!","Oh no... Oh no!! If you don't have a car, imagine what it'd feel like if your car just exploded and burned down. If you do have a car, imagine your own car in this situation. It should be a terrible feeling, if you imagine it well enough. So, when you think fire, remember the fear you had when your car was given to the flames. Now you have to walk everywhere, sad :(",kanji level2
五,five,ご,いつ,五,Five,"The radical and the kanji are the same, so make sure you know the radical to know the meaning of this kanji as well (five).","Know your radicals, friend-o.","What do you have five of? The thing that comes to most people's minds is fingers (or toes). With these five fingers, you can do anything. Most notably, though, you can play the game 'go' (ご)- a game popular strategy board game in Japan.","When you think of your five fingers, imagine yourself playing the game go. If you don't know the game, look it up and watch some videos - you'll be able to imagine yourself playing it enough to remember the reading if you do. Focus on the hands while watching. See what the players do with their five fingers.",kanji level2
四,four,よん　(し),"よん, よ","口, 儿","Mouth, Legs","Imagine contorting yourself in such a way that your legs end up inside your mouth. You have bent your body in all the wrong ways in order to achieve this. In fact, if you look at yourself, you look like a square now... You're just a person with four sides.","If you can get to square, you should be able to get to four as well, since squares always have four sides.","Despite how amazing this feat you just completed is, the audience watching you is really bored. 'Yawn' (よん) they say, politely covering their mouth.","Try to be a little upset about this. You did something crazy, but nobody is reacting. They are bored? What the heck? Zoom your imagination in on their yawns, especially. How can they be that tired by your four-sides trick?",kanji level2
才,genius,さい,-,"十, 丿","Cross, Slide","You have a cross. Why is there a slide / stroke going through the cross? Why, because religion really was a 'stroke of genius.' Oh, and see that little hook at the bottom? That's because once they hook onto you, they never let go. More genius!","When you think about crosses and religion, it's hard to help but think of how it's changed and affected history. Someone was pretty genius at some point.","Who do you know who's a genius? You don't even have to know them personally. Just think of them, and *sigh* (さい) when you do. Ugh, look at that genius over there. *Sigh*","The important part for remembering this kanji's reading is the feeling. You're so exasperated by how genius this person is, and how jealous you are about it. Do the sigh for real, too, if it will help. Just be sure to have that sighing feeling when you think about this person. The more realistic the (imagined) feeling, the more likely you are to remember this kanji's reading, too!",kanji level2
手,hand,て　(しゅ),て,手,Hand,The hand radical and the hand kanji are identical in looks and meaning! That should make things easy!,Make sure you're studying your radicals. It won't be forever that radicals and kanji overlap so nicely like this!,"To remember the reading て we will use the word 'Television.' You have great hands. Go ahead and look at them. OH MY GOD. You have little televisions (て) on your hands. They are playing the dumbest show you can think of, too, both hands at the same time.","You try to shake your hands off, but it's no good. The televisions are stuck, and the volume won't go down. You have no idea how you got these televisions on your hands. All you know is that you want them off right this instant.",kanji level2
天,heaven,てん,あま,天,Heaven,"The radical heaven is the same as the kanji heaven, making this an easy kanji to memorize.","If you know your radicals well (and you should!) you know the meaning of this kanji well, as well!","Heaven... nowadays, people aren't all that good. Things have gotten bad. That's why the acceptance rate to get into heaven is only ten (てん) percent!","Imagine yourself in line to get into heaven. You're super worried, because you're not sure if you'll get in. You heard there was a one in ten chance... those aren't good odds. Feel nervous in your imagination. Feel worried. Feel the pressure as you get closer and closer to the gate... will you make it?? Ten percent!",kanji level2
刀,sword,とう,かたな,刀,Sword,"The radical and the meaning of this kanji are almost the same, but not quite. It's very easy, though - the radical is sword. We're learning Japanese, so can you name a Japanese sword. That's right, the most common is a katana, which happens to be the meaning of this kanji as well.","The progression on this one is important. When you think sword you have to think 'what kinds of swords do Japanese people have?' Then, you'll reach the meaning of this kanji on your own.","So now you have this sweet katana in your hands and you're swinging it around like an idiot. Feel free to make 'whooshing' noises as you swing it around. To become a master katana wielder, you decide to travel to Tokyo (とう). Tokyo has the best katana schools in the world, so it makes sense to travel to Tokyo.","Imagine yourself trying to travel to Tokyo with your katana. Airport security is not happy with you trying to take a katana on the plane, so you get a full cavity search. How awful.",kanji level2
王,king,おう,-,王,King,The king kanji and the king radical are the same!,"Hopefully you're a king of radicals... because if you are, this kanji meaning was super easy for you!",Oh (おう) Great KING… Please don’t kill me… Oh Great KING.,"Unfortunately, there isn’t a really good way to learn this one using mnemonics, just because the “oh” sound is so common. If you can get used to thinking “Oh King” as something natural when it comes to thinking of the word “king” you should be alright. I’m not saying it’ll be totally easy, but try and think “king” then think “oh king” then “king” then “oh king” a few times (or more) and it should create a connection strong enough to help you remember the on’yomi. If that doesn’t work, there’s always common vocab – and luckily there’s no kun’yomi to confuse you.",kanji level2
左,left,ひだり (さ),ひだり,"工, ナ","Construction, Narwhal","The Narwhal construction group wants to build houses for narwhals. Instead of speaking for the narwhals like the right (右) does, they take action and build houses for narwhals that need homes. These people are members of the left, liberal political party. Of course, they're using lots of high taxes to pay for these houses, which the right doesn't like. That's how you know the left is involved in the construction.","Imagine a bunch of hippies building the houses. That's how you'll know they're the liberal group, and on the left.","This is a long reading to learn compared to normal (because this kanji primarily uses kun'yomi for its reading). Imagine all the construction workers with a funny accent. Whenever they walk by, they say ""Hi Da'ri"" (ひだり) which is supposed to be ""Hi There,"" or ""Hi Dearie."" You're not sure which, but he's definitely saying ""Hidari"" at you.","I don't know what country these people are from, but imagine the phrase in a silly way in order to help your self to remember it.",kanji level2
中,"middle, inside",ちゅう,なか,中,Middle,"The radical Middle and the kanji Middle are both the same. So if you know one, you know the other.","Make sure you're studying your radicals, otherwise you might find yourself in the middle of a kanji-learning problem.","To remember the reading for this kanji, we use the word chewbacca to pull up ちゅう in our memory. If you remember back to the radical 中, the middle of your mouth was stabbed with a stick. You look up to see who did it. There stands Chewbacca over you, doing his Chewbacca yell. He has another stick too, and this time he plants it right in the middle of your head.",Imagine the fear and shock you'd feel after finding out it was Chewbacca who stabbed the middle of your mouth (and head). Give him a touch and smell too - it'll help you to remember this reading.,kanji level2
月,moon,"げつ, がつ",つき,月,Moon,The moon kanji is made up of the moon radical.,This should be EZPZ as long as you know the radicals already!,"Since げつ and がつ are quite similar, we'll use one mnemonic to cover both of them. I expect your experience learning Japanese throughout the future will help you to memorize and differentiate between the two. When the moon goes down and goes away, everyone in the world gets (げつ) up, because that means it's going to be daytime soon!","This one might not be as memorable at first, but if you think of the moon, and think about what people do when the moon is up, you'll come to sleeping. Then naturally you can think about what happens when the moon goes down... people gets up!",kanji level2
々,repeater,のま,のま,"丶, 勹","Drop, Enclosure","This is a strange kanji because it doesn't really mean anything at all. In fact, what it does is it repeats the kanji that comes before it. For example: 人々 is actually 人人. This kanji shows up whenever there's a repeating kanji, because it's often easier to write than writing a more complicated kanji twice. That's why this kanji is the repeater. It repeats what comes before it. To remember that this kanji is the repeater, though, think of a drop going into an enclosure. Drip drop drip drop. It does that over and over again even after it fills up. The dropping of the drops is the repeater portion.","Since this kanji doesn't really have a meaning as much as it does a function, try to change the way you think about it when you're memorizing it.","In Japanese, this symbol is often called the のま because it looks like the katakana characters ノ and マ put together. If you know katakana then this will be easy to read. If you don't, think of it this way: Your mom is the repeater. She is trying to force feed you over and over again until you explode (literally). You keep yelling 'No ma!' (のま) but she doesn't stop. She's on a repeating track, never stopping, repeating forever.","If you feel like you're so full you're about to burst, and if you imagine your mom doing this to you (how could you, ma?) you should be able to remember the reading of this kanji. That being said, the reading is mostly only useful in the event that you have to identify a 々 - otherwise, you won't see it much.",kanji level2
田,rice paddy,た (でん),た,田,Rice Paddy,"The rice paddy radical and the rice paddy kanji are the same, making this one super easy to remember, at least meaning-wise.","Just know your radicals, and you will know your kanji as well.","To remember the reading た, we use the word 'taco.' You're in the rice field... but when you lean down to examine the rice more closely, you see that it's not rice that's growing, it's a bunch of little tacos, blossoming out of the ground.",Smell the tacos. Touch the tacos. Taste the tacos. This is definitely a very strange rice field.,kanji level2
右,right,"みぎ　(う, ゆう)",みぎ,"口, ナ","Mouth, Narwhal","The Narwhal mouths. These are a group of people who speak on behalf of the narwhals. Strangely, though, in terms of political party, it's the right that's representing these majestic animals.","The right are protesting gun rights and lower taxes for narwhals. Make sure you think it's strange that the right would even ask for these things for narwhals, let alone try to represent the narwhals... something's fishy here.","This far-right narwhal group is getting militaristic, too. They're buying MIG (みぎ) fighter jets from the Russians to protect their Narwhal Friends.","See lines and lines of MIGS on the ice where the Narwhal's live. I hope you have a little fear of this. They are scary, these jets.",kanji level2
六,six,ろく,む,"ハ, 亠","Fins, Lid","Just imagine a beast with a lid for a head and fins for feet, running around looking as insane as possible (really imagine it!). When it runs up to you, it shows you the top of its lid-head. On it is written the numbers 666. Why? Because it's a spawn of the devil, and the number six is the devil's number.","Imagine this beast doing various crazy things, the crazier the better (to help you remember). Make sure all these things are associated with the devil and the devil's number (six), so you can remember the meaning of this kanji.","Whenever we need to remember the reading ろく we just use the word rock. So, think about the devil and the devil's number. What is often associated with those things? Why, rock (ろく) and roll is. Imagine the lid-head fin-legged beast suddenly blasting out rock music in the middle of his destructive mayhem.","Sing along with the monster, if it helps you to remember the reading of this kanji.",kanji level2
小,small,しょう,"ちい, こ, お",小,Small,The small radical and the small kanji are exactly the same.,"So, know the radicals and you'll know the kanji. Nice how that works out.","This small kanji would be a terrible gift to give to the shogun. This is the shogun's least favorite kanji since it's so small. The shogun's wife really likes it though, so the shogun gives it to her.","Imagine something really really small... so small you can barely even see it. That thing is this kanji. As such, the shogun really dislikes it since it doesn't look powerful. The shogun's wife thinks it's super cute though. Imagine the shogun's wife giggling and squealing over how cute it is.",kanji level2
土,soil,"ど, と",つち,土,Grave,"The radical grave makes up the entirety of this kanji. In a grave, it's filled in with one thing, soil.","Imagine yourself filling up a grave, shoveling in shovelfuls of soil. It's sad business, especially since you're burying someone/something really important to you :( In your imagination, smell the soil that you're scooping in. Touch it and feel it too. Using more of your senses (even in your imagination) will help you to remember the meaning of this kanji (and any kanji) more effectively.","To remember the reading ど, we will use the word 'dog'. As you're burying this important thing with soil, a dog (ど) runs up and starts unburying it, very frantically. You try to stop it, but it snarls and snaps at you and tries to get you to back up. Turns out, the dog keeps digging past your buried object, and unburies a ghost dog, which jumps out and takes over your body. Feel what a dog feels, because you've just been taken over by a dead dog.",Make sure you remember all the mnemonics in order as sort of a progression of one story. They connect to each other because it's easier to remember things that connect / continue. So if you remember the pieces as a whole you're more likely to remember all the things you need to remember!,kanji level2
立,stand,りつ,た,立,Stand,"The radical stand and the kanji stand are the same thing, so now you know them both.","If you're keeping up with your radical studies, you're also keeping up with your kanji studies!",Think of someone who has to stand up straight for you. These people are pros in hospitality. These are the doormen at the Ritz (りつ).,"Imagine the doormen being extra straight… too straight in their standing. On their uniform is “The Ritz” written in fine lettering, and as you walk past them, they stand up straight and say “Welcome to the Ritz!” Whatever you do, while you’re thinking about it, make sure you think about how they stand up so straight, and associate it with these doormen, who work, specifically, at the Ritz. If you effectively imagine all this, you should be able to remember this on’yomi. Go through it like it’s a movie in your head!",kanji level2
石,stone,いし (せき),いし,石,Stone,The stone radical and stone kanji are the same thing!,Know your radicals and therefore know your kanji. It's just that simple.,You throw a stone through a window... that was surprisingly easy (いし).,"Reading's a bit of a stretch, but the goal is to get you to the correct reading, so do your best to make sure it does just that!",kanji level2
丁,"street, ward","ちょう, てい",-,丁,Nail,This kanji is made up of the nail radical. Where would you hate to see nails? The worst place to scatter nails would be the street because of all the cars driving by.,Imagine someone spreading nails out all over the street and watching cars hitting them and popping all the tires. Who would do such a terrible thing?,"Who is spreading these nails on the street? That is Mrs. Chou (ちょう), who will be popping up from time to time in the future as well (so be sure to get a good image of her in your head).","Might be sort of racist, but we gotta do this for memory's sake, right? Mrs. Chou is an evil little Asian lady. She hates everyone and does bad things to others for her enjoyment. Her laugh even sounds like her name. Imagine her laughing, saying 'Chou chou chou chou,' she says while spreading nails all over the street. She's like some evil Asian Santa Claus, or something.",kanji level2
日,"sun, day","にち, じつ","ひ, か, び",日,Sun,"The sun radical and sun kanji are the same, huzzah! Also, if you want to remember day as well, you can just think about how a day is the time it takes for the sun to cross the sky.","The radical for this one is easy too, making the meaning for this kanji super easy as well!","There are so many on'yomi for this kanji, but since this kanji is so important and common, you'll end up learning them all eventually whether you want to or not. For now, you're only going to have to learn one of the readings, and that one is にち. The sun is so hot. It focused its rays to take out one man... and that man is Friedrich Nietzsche (にち), famous philosopher. He philosophized one too many things about the sun, so the sun decided it was time he paid.","This reading will be easier to remember if you know of Friedrich Nietzsche... so do your research and learn about him if you don't. He's a pretty historical dude. Imagine the sun totally pissed off, too. It makes a grunting noise as it builds up a sun beam to blast him off the face of the earth. Also note that there's another reading worth learning as well: じつ. The reading can be remembered by thinking 'Gee! Two readings?' Because, seriously, two readings? Too many...",kanji level2
千,thousand,せん,ち,千,Thousand,"This kanji looks like and means the same thing as the radical, which makes it particularly easy to remember.",As long as you know the radical thousand then you know the kanji thousand as well!,"Remember the thousand crosses you got stuck under while learning the radical 千? You're still under it. Then, suddenly, someone pops his head over you and says 'hey, I'll save you... but only for a thousand cents (せん). Go ahead and try to calculate what that would come out to. It's not that expensive, actually","But, the problem is even though you have a thousand cents in your pocket, you can't get them out. You're stuck under all these crosses.

Hear the coins falling on the ground.",kanji level2
木,"tree, wood",もく,"き, こ",木,Tree,This is another kanji that is the same as the radical. Both tree and tree are the same in looks and meaning.,"So, how are those radicals doing? Do you know them well?","You’re walking through the trees, looking at them. They look ominous. Then, your foot gets stuck in the muck (もく) and you try to pull your leg out, but can’t.

水,water,すい,みず,水,Water,The water radical and the water kanji are the same.,"So as long as you know the radicals, you know the kanji.","Imagine a lake (i.e. a a whole bunch of water). When you think of water, you should try to think of this beautiful lake. It’s sunny, the trees smell nice (imagine a tree smell if you can – the more senses you use the better!) and on that tree there is an awesome tire swing (すい). You get onto the tire swing and you swinging back and forth. The water is right in front of you, and you are able to use the swing to throw yourself into the water. It’s a lot colder than you expected, and you come back to the surface, gasping for breath. The water gets into your mouth and you taste it. How strange, it’s very, very sweet. Imagine the sweetness of the water and how weird it is (really really sweet, this water is).","I know that was a long one, but try to imagine all the different bits. Try to feel the feelings (cold, smell, etc) too. The more you create in this fake memory (which you’re using to remember and associate water with すい (swing)) the more likely you are to end up remembering enough to make it happen. Especially when it comes to the senses part, the more vividly you imagined it, the more likely you are to remember the on’yomi.",kanji level2

The colors are important, and the excitement of the winner holding up the hacked iPhone is too.",kanji level2
文,writing,"ぶん, もん",-,文,Doll,"The doll means writing. This is one of those rare instances where the kanji and the radical meanings don't match (even though they look the same). To remember this one, Imagine a doll walking around. It's evil, obviously. You don't see it walking around, but you know it is. You keep finding nasty notes... writing that she has done while you're asleep, telling you nasty things and threatening you.",Feel the fear of this as if it were actually happening. Writing? From a doll?? Imagine the things she could write to you and be afraid. Dolls really are terrifying.,"This is one of the unfortunate situations where the kanji has multiple important readings to learn... The doll's writing states a couple of demands. First, the doll demands that you give her more bread buns (ぶん). Second, she demands you stop calling her a monster. She does not appreciate this. She is a little girl.","Make sure you read these demands out slowly in your mind. Think about each demand she has, and think about how ridiculous they are. First of all, dolls don't eat buns. Second, she's totally a monster. You better make a decision, though, and act it out in your head. Dolls don't like to be kept waiting.",kanji level2
円,"yen, round",えん,まる,"亠, 冂","Lid, Head","The combination of radicals for this kanji may not be obvious at first, but if you look carefully you'll see it. The lid is inside the head for this kanji because it's holding something in. Imagine the top of someone's head being closed by a lid. Open that lid up and peer inside... it's full of yen coins, the Japanese money system.","Another thing that will help is to associate the word round to this kanji, because it has both of these meanings. Both are right, and if you learn one that's better than not learning either, but maybe if you think about how round the coins themselves are inside this person's head, you'll remember this one too.","What does the word yen sound like? It sounds like えん. Why? because back in the day, Japanese used to have a 'ye' sound, but now it doesn't. Instead, it's an 'e' sound, which is why yen = えん. Alternatively, you can pull one of these yen coins out of this guy's head and examine it closely. Upon inspection, you find out they're knockoffs. They're not yen. They're En (えん)!","Feel disappointed that this huge money stash is worthless. En are not as good as yen, that's for sure.",kanji level2
矢,arrow,や (し),や,矢,Arrow,"The arrow radical and the arrow kanji are the same.

What is this arrow doing? It’s following around all the Yankee (や) baseball players, stalking them, waiting to make its move (I’ll let you decide what it’s “move” is).","Imagine the arrow as a human-sized living thing with legs, arms, and clothes, though.

Then, think about how dumb it was to try to use seven swords at once, and then feel the pain of the cut you gave yourself. Ouch, ouch ouch.","Because having seven swords for yourself is too much, you decide to take the swords and divide them up amongst pairs of people. You cut them into pairs, and give sets (せつ) to everyone who needs them in the village.","Just make sure you think about how you need to give them away in sets, and not anything else. This is the most important thing to think about in your head as you're trying to establish the mnemonic for your kanji reading memory. It's gotta be sets.",kanji level3
方,"direction, way",かた　(ほう),かた,方,Direction,"The radical and the kanji for direction are the same! Huzzah! There is also another meaning too, though. This can also mean way as well.

It'll help you to remember that this kanji means 'fat.'",This poor fat guy has trouble with a lot of things. One of the things he has the most trouble with is tying a tie (たい).,"Imagine him trying to tie the tie but he can't lift his hands around to do it. You have to help him out. Another thing that might help you to remember this kanji's reading is that it's the same reading as 大 (or, one of the same readings).

Only a few people are required to create a slide traffic jam, though :(","Why is there a little traffic jam on the slide? Because the shogun (しょう) is using the slide, causing everyone to stop and watch, even though there are people backed up behind him. How inconsiderate.","Imagine this in your head.

毛,"fur, hair",もう,け,毛,Fur,"Fur and fur are the same as each other, so the meaning of this kanji should be simple. This can also mean hair, too, though more like furry hair.","Just make sure you're studying your radicals, otherwise it won't be as simple as I'd hoped.","With fur, wisp your imagination to a land where there are stalks of fur all around, just like a big tall grassy field (except instead of grass, it’s fur).

There’s just too much hair! To get rid of it, you’ll need to mow (もう) it down with a lawn mower. Imagine yourself starting up the lawn mower, and taking it around, mowing down the hair. Hear the sound of the mower in your head (they’re loud and distinct). The important thing is to imagine yourself mowing everything. Key is to think “fur → In the fur → getting rid of the fur → mow the fur,” in that order. That’ll get you to mow, which will help you to remember the on’yomi.","Smell the fur as you mow it down.

If anyone out there is full of life, it's got to be Hard Gay, especially when he's shouting 'Sei (せい), sei, sei!' He's so excited about everything, and has a great time with other people. What an awesome life.","If you don't know Hard Gay, you should definitely search Hard Gay on YouTube... I promise it won't be as bad as it sounds... and, it'll help you to learn your kanji better, strangely. Just be sure to come back here when you're done, because you have kanji to study!",kanji level3
久,long time,"ひさ　(きゅう, く)",ひさ,久,Raptor Cage,"The raptor cage is a reinforced enclosure, so it will hold those raptors in for a really long time.","You've seen Jurassic Park, though. You know this isn't true... Be suspicious of whoever's telling you this.","Turns out, the person telling you is a big idiot. It's Jar Jar Binks.

台,machine,"だい, たい",-,"口, ム","Mouth, Pile","There's a pile of stuff that's going to be put inside your mouth... and it is terrible stuff. There's cars, microwave ovens, televisions, and more, and somehow you have to put them all in your mouth. This is some kind of torture, so feel the fear of what you're about to go through. The reason you want to imagine these things going into your mouth in particular is because these things are machines, and this is the machine counter kanji that you're learning.","If you need extra help remembering, you'll have to imagine these big machines being put into your mouth, stretching your cheeks out huge and filling it up. This is the most painful thing ever, but somehow you're able to put this pile of machines in your mouth... you'll live another day.","Finally, you're in luck. The police and emergency services have found you and saved you (feel the relief of that!). But, because you're full of cars and microwave ovens, they can't fit you in the ambulance (feel the disappointment at that). They do everything they can to get you out of there and back to the hospital but you're too big. You just die (だい) right there while they try to shove you into various emergency vehicles.","Imagine the conversation the emergency people would have... 'we can fit him in...' 'If we don't get him in, he'll die!' 'Well, I guess he's going to die then...' Wait, they're going to let me die???",kanji level3
母,mother,はは　(ぼ),はは,母,Drawer,"The drawer radical looks like the mother kanji, though their meanings are different. Still, this isn't too far of a stretch. Who's the nice person that folds and puts your clothes in your drawer? That's your mother.","On the other hand, you can imagine your mother yelling at you to put your clothes away in your drawers as well. Either way, just make sure your mother is involved in this mnemonic.","Whenever your mother tells you to put away your own clothes in your drawer though, you just laugh. 'Ha ha!' you say.","HAHA this!! your mother might reply, slapping you across the head.",kanji level3
午,noon,ご,-,"丿, 干","Slide, Antenna",The antenna picks up your favorite show about slides every day at noon.,"You know this because at noon you're always busy eating lunch, and you can't watch the awesome reality slide television show that you so want to watch more than anything! Make sure you feel this way in your heart (at least in your imagination) because it will help you to remember that this kanji means noon, because noon is when your 'slides-show' comes on the TV via the antenna.","Because you can't watch TV at noon, you find you have to watch TV at another time. That time is Five (ご) o'clock, and it's a TV show about the game of go (ご).","It's so boring, though, and you hate it. Feel the boredom and the frustration of having to watch a stupid show about go when you could be watching a show about slides at noon. I guess go will have to do :(",kanji level3
北,north,ほく,きた,ヒ,"Spoon, Nailbat","The nailbat and spoon are your weapons (what else would you do with a nailbat and spoon combination? Prolly nothing). What will you do with these things? You're going up to the North Pole to take out that two-timing, scheming bearded elf slave-driver named Santa.","If you need help, think that you'll use the nailbat to take out Santa, and the spoon to dig a grave and bury him. Things might get kinda graphic in your head, but just know that it's for the sake of memorization, and even Santa has to make sacrifices some time. Also, focus on the location as well. You know that Santa is at the North Pole. Think about how that's where you need to go to finish your job.","You find Santa and hit him with your nailbat and spoon. Because you hit him in the stomach, he hocks (ほく) up an elf.","The elf falls out of Santa's mouth all slimy and covered with nasty Santa-throat things. Then, Santa hocks up a hairball. Too much beard grooming, I guess.",kanji level3
今,now,こん,いま,ラ,"Ra, Hat","We theoretically have the Egyptian God Ra wearing a hat to help us to remember this kanji. Just think about this God, wearing a silly hat... maybe one of those ones with a propeller. He takes off his hat and wants someone to take it from him right NOW.","He is an incredibly impatient God. That is something you'll have to remember when thinking about this, because impatient gods want things done right NOW!","When we need to remember the reading こん, we'll use the word 'Condor.' When Ra gets his hat taken off his head, the servant runs off with it to put it away someplace safe. Suddenly, a Condor (こん) swoops down grabbing the hat, tearing it away from the servant. Ra is pissed, and shoots the condor down, burning his hat and the condor.","Imagine the surprise of a condor going for a hat like that, especially a god like Ra's hat. Must have been really cool for a condor to do that.",kanji level3
古,old,こ,ふる,古,Old,"The old radical and the old kanji are one and the same, which means you know them both.","Know your radicals, and you will know your kanji.","To remember the reading こ, we will use 子 (ko/child). A child is the opposite of someone really really old, so use this disparity to remember the reading here.","Imagine a really old man writing this content and next to him there is also a child. Use these two contrasting images to remember that this kanji shares the same reading as 子, こ.",kanji level3
兄,older brother,あに (きょう),あに,"口, 儿","Mouth, Legs","Who's someone who's just a mouth with legs? That's your know-it-all older brother, who won't shut up about anything.","To help this mnemonic along, literally imagine your older brother as someone that's just a giant mouth with a pair of legs walking it around. It talks and talks and talks, too, irritating you. Feel the irritation specifically at your older brother. He's older than you, so you can't beat him up... yet.","The strange thing about your older brother is that he has odd powers... some would say powers of the force. Do you know what his name is? It's Ani (あに), short for Anikin... wait a sec, does that sound familiar?","Be sure to be surprised to find out your older brother is actually the future Darth Vader. Now imagine your mouth-legs older brother wielding a light saber, coming at you... 'Ani!!!' you yell... but it's no good, because mouths don't have ears.",kanji level3
元,origin,"げん, がん",もと,元,Origin,"The radical and the kanji are the same! You're in luck, today.","As long as you know your radicals, you'll be good to move on to the reading, which isn't as easy, unfortunately.","What is your origin, in the grand scheme of things? What generation were you? I was Gen-Y (げん), for example. You might be Gen-X, or something else.","Important thing is to think about your origin in terms of your generation, because that will help you to remember the reading of this kanji. Of course, the word 'generation' and げん have a different 'G' sound, but the goal is to get you close enough in your brain to pull out the actual memory of the correct reading, not to use the exact same sounds. If you get close enough to the spot where げん=元 is stored, you'll be able to retrieve it a lot more easily.",kanji level3
外,outside,がい,"そと, はず","ト, 夕","Toe, Evening","You're known to get the ailment evening toe, which is when your toe catches on fire after getting really, really hot (imagine this happening, ouch!). The only way to fix it is to cool your toe down, and the best way to do that is to go outside.","After imagining your evening toe overheating, rush outside to fix it. It's the best way to prevent fire toe, which is way worse. In the evening it's nice and cold outside too, so feel this on your skin, and feel the cold air on your toe, which is starting to get some relief.","You go outside (you’re not supposed to be out there at night!) and you’re accosted by a couple of guys. Then, all of a sudden, Guy Fawkes jumps from the roof above you and takes them out, then starts running. “Guy Fawkes!” you yell after him!","If you don’t know Guy Fawkes, you should do a little reading up on him to make this mnemonic make sense. Also, Anonymous People wear a Guy Fawkes mask, if that helps any.",kanji level3
分,"part, understand, minute","ぶん, ふん, ぶ",わ,"ハ, 刀","Fins, Sword",The fins that fell onto my sword were sliced into two parts.,The logic of this story makes a lot of sense - even in the kanji itself the fins are falling onto the sword from above. What happens to things that fall onto swords? They become more than one part.,"Now that you've cut the fish, it's time to cut something else into parts. Next on your list is the buns (ぶん) which need to be split up amongst the people. If you'd like to learn the second reading, just think about how fun (ふん) it will be to do this task.","Think about the buns (ぶん) as absolutely delicious things you want to eat really bad. If you want to eat the buns, and you taste the buns in your imagination, you'll surely remember that the reading for this kanji is ぶん as well.",kanji level3
公,public,こう,-,"ハ, ム","Fins, Pile",The pile of fins left on the ground was for anyone. It was left there for the public.,"Imagine someone dumping these fins, and the public just waiting greedily. When they're dumped, they bum rush the pile and get as many fins as they can. The public loves their fins.","When we need to remember こう, we'll think of こういち, the person who writes all these things. Hopefully I'm not too abstract in your mind - if I am, take a second to memorize my name, so that way you can memorize a lot of kanji that use the reading こう as well! So, who's the greediest member of the public knocking people out of the way, stealing fins from children and old ladies? Of course, that's the horrible こういち. I'm so, so evil when it comes to getting my fins.",Make sure you make こういち appalling in your mind. How can someone even act like this? How can someone be so terrible? These questions should come to mind while you're imagining me throwing babies to the side to get closer to the pile of fins.,kanji level3
引,pull,ひ (いん),ひ,弓,"Spring, Stick","If you put a stick on a spring, and then pull it, what would happen?","Go ahead and imagine the result, but be sure to pull on it really hard because the spring you have is thick and good quality. When you let go, what happens? Does it hit someone? Does it cause some kind of weird disaster? I'll leave that up to you - the important thing is you're pulling on the stick against the spring to do something interesting with it.","Amazingly, your spring propelled stick flies right into the heel of Achilles. You know what happens when he gets hit in the heel, don't you?","Imagine him grabbing his heel, screaming like a little baby. That's his weakness after all (that's why they call it the Achilles Heel and not something else). He falls to the ground and slowly groans himself to death, all because of your little stick.",kanji level3
止,stop,し,"と, や",止,Stop,"The radical and the kanji for stop are the same, so hopefully it shouldn't be any trouble for you.","If this kanji meaning is giving you trouble, it just means you need to study your radicals more... so... do that, okay?","When we need to remember the sound し, we use the word 'Charlie Sheen.' - When you think stop, do you also think 'stop sign'? I hope you do. You're coming up to a stop sign, and on top of it, standing straight up and down, you see Charlie Sheen, saluting the sky. Even before you come to a stop, Sheen starts yelling 'STOPP! STOPPP!!' and jumps down onto the hood of your car, breaking the windshield in.","Make sure to feel the curiosity of someone standing like that on a stop sign. Then, feel the surprise when you figure out it's a celebrity standing up there. Lastly, feel the fear as he jumps onto your car and busts your windshield. See his face on the glass, looking in on you, all crazy like.",kanji level3
用,"task, use",よう,もち,用,Elephant,"The elephant is a large animal. It's huge, and can accomplish any task. You are able to use this elephant to finish your task, as well.","Look at your elephant... now think 'what can this sucker do?' Then, look at your task list. Come up with some ridiculous tasks for it to do and imagine them out in your head. Focus on the task list as you go through. Oh, also, 'task' sounds like 'tusk' and elephants have tusks... just a little extra juice to help you to remember.","To remember the reading よう, we use the word 'yogurt.' - Unfortunately, your elephant (which can achieve any task) runs out of power. The elephant collapses, and you have to pull off a big jug of yogurt (よう) off its back, and put its trunk in it to recharge him.","Imagine the smell of the yogurt (it's getting kind of gross because you're in the sun). Also, listen to the elephant sucking down the yogurt, recharging itself. Be sure to think that it's a bit odd an elephant would run on yogurt, but you won't question what has to be done.",kanji level3
万,ten thousand,"まん, ばん",-,刀,"Sword, Leaf","He cut the leaf with his sword at 10,000 miles per hour (or kilometers, if you're from one of those countries).","When you see these two radicals, you should think, what would I do to a leaf with a sword? You'd cut it as fast as you could. At 10,000 mph.","When you cut the leaf in half with your sword at ten thousand mph, it falls into the ocean. The ripples in the water attract ten thousand manatees (まん). They jump out of the water and swarm you, and you can feel their little manatee mouths all over you, tearing you apart.","Whenever we need to remember the reading まん we'll use the word 'manatee' - it's better than something generic like 'man.' Be sure to feel the manatees all over your body, chomping and biting you. The pain will help you to remember the reading. Keep thinking how you wish you hadn't let the leaf fall in the ocean, because it's what attracted them in the first place.",kanji level3
広,wide,ひろ (こう),ひろ,"ム, 广","Pile, Mullet","A disgusting pile of mullets. But, you're intrigued, so you pick up a mullet and try it on. Unfortunately, it's way too wide for your head.","When you put on the mullet, imagine it being super flappy on the sides because it's way too big. It's like there's wings on the sides, though from back to front it fits well. It's really just too wide.","When you put the wide mullet on, though, you feel like a different person. The disguise gives you strength. Soon, they will call you a hero (ひろ).","Imagine yourself running around with the mullet on, stopping crime. The mullet gives you a superpower too - to become really, really wide, whenever you want. This is good for blocking people from going down alleyways. You are the Hero this city deserves, Mulletman/woman.",kanji level3
冬,winter,ふゆ (とう),ふゆ,"二, 夂","Two, Winter","We have the winter radical and the two radical (though it's sort of slanted). What's two times the winter radical, if radicals are just a part of a kanji? Two times would be enough to create the entire kanji, which is also winter.","You could also think, 'Winter too' instead of 'two.' Because, this kanji is in fact 'winter too.'",This kanji is a little different from the radical 夂 though has the same meaning… but don’t let that fool you (ふゆ).,"Try to spend a little extra time with this one - the mnemonic isn't as strong as it could be, so you'll need to add a little extra old-fashioned memorization to this soup if you want to remember it later. ふゆ ふゆ ふゆ...",kanji level3
竹,bamboo,たけ,たけ,竹,Bamboo,The bamboo radical and the bamboo kanji are exactly the same!,Just make sure you know your radicals!,"There's a little bamboo shrub sitting there, holding onto a lollipop. Because you're bigger than the bamboo shrub, you just take (たけ) it from the bamboo, causing it to cry.","Of course, focus on the absurdity of a bamboo shrub that can cry and eat a lollipop. Also, think about how mean you are to take the lollipop away from a defenseless bamboo shrub in the first place!",kanji level4
車,car,しゃ,くるま,車,Car,The radical car and the kanji car are exactly the same.,Make sure you study your radicals... though don't do it while driving.,"When we need to remember the reading しゃ, we use 'shaman'. There's a car. It's the nicest car you've ever seen. Exquisite, beautiful. Wouldn't you be surprised to learn it belongs to a shaman (しゃ)? Well it does. This shaman charges a premium for his shaman services so he can afford fancy cars like this.","The more fantastic you make this car, the better.

Then, come up with some crazy way / invention you're going to copy him. Are you cloning? Are you just taking his skin? Are you removing his forehead to grab his brain? Up to you - just make sure you make it ridiculous enough to remember.","To remember the reading しゃ, we use the word 'shaman'. You finally decide on how you're going to copy him. You hire a shaman (しゃ) and have the shaman perform a sacred shaman cloning ritual.","The shaman runs around for a bit, doing ridiculous things. Imagine it dancing about and mumbling shamanic chants as the beggar is copied.",kanji level4
仕,doing,し,つか,"ｲ, 士","Leader, Samurai",The leader samurai didn't become leader by sitting around not taking action. He got to where he is by doing.,"Think through all the doing he may have done in this past. Not all of it was easy, but it was actions, not sitting that moved him forward in life... just like with you! Learning kanji is about action, not about waiting. Learn a bit every day and good things will happen.","When remembering the reading し we use Charlie 'Sheen.' - You go to visit the leader samurai who's known for doing rather than waiting. You walk into his room, and he's facing away from you. When he turns to face you, it's Charlie Sheen (し) sitting there. He's the samurai leader... what the!",You!? YOU are the samurai leader?

早,"early, fast",そう,"はや, さ","十, 日","Cross, Sun","When the sun is over the cross it's time to go to church... which is so darn early. This kanji can also mean fast too.

You check the alarm clock, and instead of displaying the time, it just says early on it, flashing in big red letters.","To remember そう we use the word 'sew' - You wake up really early to go to church. When you arrive and go inside, the doors slam behind you, and a couple of armed guards grab you and throw you forward to a desk with a sewing machine on it. They then yell at you 'SEW!!' (そう) and you're forced to start sewing. Church tricked you... it's actually a sweat shop where you sew clothes for no pay, and now you're stuck here.","Make sure to follow the whole story along (starting at the meaning) and make your way to the church. Open the door and go inside, and look around (probably all tired-like, because it's early). When you just start to figure out what's going on, you get the shock of being grabbed and thrown into a chair, and then you start sewing and keep sewing, until you feel your fingers numbing up.",kanji level4
気,"energy, spirit","き, け",いき,"メ, 气","Treasure, Energy","You're looking for a treasure, but no normal treasure... a treasure that's a stash of energy. Not gold, money, or anything like that.

The animals all come running, knock everything over (including your house) causing everything to be flat.","Imagine yourself, your house, your cat, your everything... all completely flat... ridiculously so (the more ridiculous the better). This kanji also means peace. Why? Because flat things are nice and peaceful. They aren't bumpy. They aren't uneven. They're just flat.

Just focus on the fact that the leader is planting all these flowers for a bigger picture thing (that's what leaders do). He wants there to be flowers for future generations as well, because he's a nice dude like that.","The leader can't stop planting flowers though. He's going crazy. Maybe it's the pollen?

You should also learn the other meaning as well, though, if you can.",What do you wear on your foot? You wear a sock (そく).,"Just think about your bare feet. Think about them too much.

世,generation,"せ, せい",よ,世,Generation,The generation radical and the generation kanji are the same.,"The same can't be said for different generations of people... they are not the same. Count your lucky stars that radicals and kanji can be, though.","For the reading, when we need to remember せい, we think Hard Gay, because he says 'SEI SEI SEI' a lot. Think of multiple generations of people - what would the older generations hate more than anything? Of course, it would have to be Hard Gay shouting 'Sei (せい), sei, sei!'","Just imagine someone of an older generation watching Hard Gay. Imagine their disgusted looks and their confusion. Hopefully you can get some joy out of their reactions, too, to help you remember the reading.

You're flailing around, trying to recover from this terrible situation. As you're moving around you step back on some uni (う) which stabs your foot. Now you have uni in your foot and a nail in your eye. This can't get any worse.","Of course, think about the feeling of these things hurting you.

He has hundreds of letters (of the alphabet) in front of him, and he's rearranging them into different equations. Absolutely crazy, this one is. He's wearing a helmet because he doesn't want the aliens to know his thoughts, and know the secret codes and equations he's creating with the letters.

Sorry for being totally sexist there – use your possible upsetedness to remember the meaning of this kanji, though, and it will be all worthwhile",Who da man? Dan's (だん) the man.,"Say this over and over in a chanty fashion, preferably with a super manly voice, if you can swing it (out loud, now). Also, if you can think of someone named Dan that you know to imagine with this, it will help you out a lot.",kanji level4
主,master,しゅ,"おも, ぬし",主,Master,The radical master and the kanji master have the same meanings! How lucky for you.,,"Do you remember back to the radical mnemonic, where the master is balancing a water drop on his head? Imagine back to there. Once you do, the most amazing thing happens. The master takes off a shoe (しゅ) and places it gently on top of the water drop, where it balances on top, not breaking the water.","Seriously, this ought to not be allowed, at least when it comes to the physics we know and love on this earth. This is so amazing, so feel amazed by it in your imagination as well. Also, it might help if his shoe is something ridiculous... like a clown shoe, or something. You choose!",kanji level4

The “evening mouth” is the most famous thing in the _____ area (this is the area you choose). He’s so famous that everybody knows his name (“Evening Mouth.”).","Imagine yourself going to the area you chose, and watching “Evening Mouth” speak. There are thousands of others there, wanting to see the giant floating mouth in the night sky. “Evening Mouth” then says “Everyone, what’s my name!?” and everyone shouts back “Evening Mouth!” in unison. “Evening Mouth” has certainly gotten really famous.","So, when does “Evening Mouth” appear? Turns out, “Evening Mouth” only comes out to talk in May (めい). You know this because it’s just starting to be spring, and when you look around (you’re watching “Evening Mouth” again) you see some spring flowers come up.","You know what they say. April showers bring May Flowers. What do May Flowers bring? They bring “Evening Mouth,” baby.",kanji level4
不,not,ふ,-,不,Not,The not and the kanji not are the same thing! That makes it easy... Not!,"Actually, it does make it easy - the radicals make kanji wayyy easier, no?","To remember ふ we'll use the word 'fool.' Think of those jokes, where someone says something, then ends with a loud 'NOTTTT!' Someone is doing that to you, over and over. What is that person? That person is a fool (ふ).",Be sure to feel irritated at that person. Think in your head as they're telling these dumb 'not' jokes how much of a fool they are... and how much of a fool you are for sitting here and listening to them.,kanji level4
号,number,ごう,-,"勹, 一, 口","Enclosure, Ground, Mouth","There's a mouth in the ground (in our case, it's a hatch), and inside is some kind of enclosure you can't quite get to.

Think over it for a while, get frustrated, and try to figure it out. You can't, though, so you probably won't ever get inside.","When remembering the reading ごう, we use 'Grandpa Koichi.' こう is こういち, so ごう is ごういち, aka 'Grandpa Koichi' (ごう). So to help you figure out these numbers, you go and contact ごういち because he is so old and wise.","Like I said, ごういち is very old and wise, so just imagine こういち, but much older. Imagine sitting with ごういち and concentrating very hard to try and figure out these numbers.",kanji level4
他,other,た,ほか,"也, ｲ","Alligator, Leader","The leader of alligators... he's no ordinary leader, that's for sure. He's not a politician.. he's not a king... He's one of the Other Ones, a group of strange, eccentric people who become leaders of animals.","Imagine different groups of leaders - they're all dressed nice and normal. Then, off to the side are the leaders who are leaders of bears, cats, alligators, and narwhals... they're the other ones, no matter how you look at it.

All of it is from the past.,"To remember the reading きょ, we'll use 'Little Kyoto'. This will differentiate きょ from きょう, which is regular sized Kyoto. Get it? Okay, so all these tombstones from the past are located in Little Kyoto (きょ). Each grave pile represents a Japanese immigrant that came to Little Kyoto and died :( Alternatively, the reading can be こ as well. Just like Little Kyoto is a little Kyoto, it is also a child kyoto, like a 子 Kyoto, making it こ as well.",Come up with some kind of emotion along with this grave. It's probably a sad emotion as death is usually pretty sad. Feel sad about these dead people in Little Kyoto. They're no longer around to do fun things or play with their families.,kanji level4
皿,plate,さら,さら,皿,Plate,"The plate kanji and the plate are exactly the same, like two matching pieces of china.","If you know your radicals, you know your kanji too.","The person washing all the dishes was named Sarah (さら). She was named that because of her large head, which was shaped like Sarah Jessica Parker’s head (very big).","Imagine someone with a huge head, washing dishes. When I say huge, I mean huge. She turns towards you with her big head and says “Hi, I’m Sarah” and you see her name tag, which also says Sarah. She is Sarah, the dish washer.

That previous grave-slide was faulty.","Emphasize thinking back to the previous slide (not the one you’re on, unless you’re thinking about how much better this one will be compared to the previous one). Imagine the previous slide, and all its nastiness (when it comes to sliding down so hard your feet are stuck in someone’s grave, you’ll have plenty of nastiness to go around).","To remember せん we use the word centaur. At the bottom of the previous grave slide, there was also a centaur as well. He started slapping you around with his hooves as your legs are stuck in the ground, and all you can do is take the beating.","Feel the scratchiness of the hooves on your face. He's not hitting you hard, but it's plenty enough to be irritating. Imagine him clopping around you in circles too, and make sure to vividly see the centaur, since that's important to the reading. Also make sure to think he's a real bastard, that centaur...",kanji level4
赤,red,あか　(せき),あか,赤,Red,The radical for red and the kanji for red are the same thing!,"What a lucky ducky - as long as you know your radicals, you'll know this kanji's meaning as well!","Think of Fozzie Bear. He says 'Wakka wakka wakka' a lot. Now, think of an evil, red (and I mean totally red) Fozzie Bear. He drops the 'w' and just says 'Aka Aka Aka,' because he's totally evil.","You'll have to think of him as really, really red, though. Like, a glowing, searing kind of red.

Just lean your head against it and close your eyes. The leader of your outfit has been working hard, and he really, really needed that rest.","To remember きゅう we use the word 'cute' - The leader who's resting under the tree suddenly gets surrounded by all the animals living in the tree... but, they're not evil, they're very, very cute (きゅう), adorable things. Squirrels with big eyes, funny birds, and so on. Everything is just so amazingly cute.",Make sure you imagine really cute things and get the 'awww' factor going in your heart. It'll help you to remember this kanji's reading.,kanji level4
申,say humbly,もう (しん),もう,"十, 口","Cross, Mouth","There’s a cross in your mouth, so the things you say are very pious.

If you do, you'll know a lot of kanji as well, almost magically!","You see something. It's walking towards you, but you need to see better. When the person comes close, you realize 'That person is me (み)!'","The struggling to see bit is pretty important - make sure that you slowly see a little better and better as the person comes closer, but it's difficult the whole time (struggles are good for memory). Then, it starts to become more and more clear, and you start saying 'that can't be me. No way it's me...' When the person comes up to you (the person, being you) you learn about parallel universes and other fabulous things. Still, the whole time you can't stop thinking about how 'this person looks just like me... no, this person is me!'",kanji level4
貝,"shellfish, clam",かい,かい,貝,Clam,"The radical, clam, is a type of shellfish. Also, we'll allow clam here too, because sometimes clams are referred to as 貝 and it's the same as the radical. I'd focus on learning the 'shellfish' version of the vocab if you can, though.",Be sure to try and differentiate 'clam' and 'shellfish' before moving on to the reading.,"To remember the reading かい we use the word “coyote” (which is pronounced kai-oh-tee) Imagine a coyote (かい) with a huge shell making up its back area. You try to punch it, but the coyote shell skin is too strong and the coyote comes at you to devour you. Suddenly, someone with a sledge hammer comes in and smashes the coyote's shell, bursting shellfish all over you.","Taste the shellfish juice, smell it, and feel it. When you think this shell, you should think of this shell coyote that tried to eat you.

皮,skin,かわ (ひ),かわ,"丿, 支","Slide, Frog","A frog decides to jump down a slide... the problem is that it's not a water slide (which is another radical). This is a regular slide he jumps down, and as a frog, his skin gets dry easily. As he slides down, his skin gets torn off him, and so he's a naked, skinless frog when he reaches the bottom.","Pick up the skin and feel it... Does it feel odd? Weird? Rubbery? Really touch it in your mind and remember how it felt. Make sure it's just the skin, too.","The frog makes it to the bottom of the slide, with no skin. He flies into a 川 (かわ), which is full of skin from all the other animals and frogs that thought it would be a good idea to use this evil slide.

代,"substitute, age, period",だい,"か, かわ, しろ","弋, ｲ","Ceremony, Leader","The leader for the ceremony wasn't available, so they had to find a substitute. It also has another meaning. A leader only missed the ceremony if he forgot what period of time it was. If he thinks he's in the wrong age, he won't come because he's trying to lead some monkeys in the ceremony instead.","First, come up with a really weird ceremony. Then, be someone who's coordinating this weird ceremony. Much to your surprise, the leader of the ceremony itself didn't show up. You have to figure something out... you have to find (and imagine yourself doing this) the substitute leader. Also, the sub does terribly - what a disaster, and it's all your fault, because you're coordinating.","Turns out you were being kind of mean. The original (who got replaced by the substitute) leader actually died (だい), and you were all pissed at them. They tried to joust a train, thinking it was a medieval age dragon. How do you feel now?

You're all wet (feel the cold wetness) and you're getting wetter. Then, this pelican comes out of the blue to keep you dry. You probably feel really really thankful about it, right?","Then you notice something else... The pelican is also holding a gun and pointing at you, and it's demanding all your money. Well, first of all, no more thanks for this pelican. Second, the gun is a bit crazy. It's a futuristic ray (れい) gun - one that looks different from any other gun you've seen.","Then, the pelican shoots a ray out of the ray gun, to show you she's not messing around. It melts the wall behind you, causing you to be totally frightened.",kanji level4
糸,thread,いと　(し),いと,糸,Thread,The thread radical and thread are the same in looks as well as and meaning.,This is why it's good to make sure you know your radicals.,"You have some thread... what's the first thing you do with it? You take it and put it in your mouth, and start sucking it down like spaghetti. You have decided to eat (いと) the thread.","Think about how it tastes. Think about how it feels in your throat.

町,town,ちょう,まち,"丁, 田","Nail, Rice Paddy","The rice paddy is full of nails. That sucks. Why is the rice field full of nails? It’s part of a town that’s known for making nails, and they dump their nails in the rice field (because rice is worth nothing to this town).",Try to feel some anger towards the town as a whole. Rice is awesome. They can’t be throwing nails in there. Jerks.,"Do you remember the kanji 丁? The on’yomi is also ちょう, and the kanji means “street.” The mnemonic for that one had to do with Mrs. Chou who was scattering nails all over the street. Oh, and guess what town that street is in? So who does that mean lives here? Yeah, it’s Mrs. Chou (ちょう).","Do you remember Mrs. Chou? She’s notorious, by now.",kanji level4

These people are planning to take the trees and cut them down to make their village.,There is a whole group of people out there who are measuring these trees. Imagine them asking each other “do you think this will be a good tree for our village center?” and other people nodding in agreement or disagreement as they measure.,They take all the wood back to where they're building their village and once they construct the village center they paint a mural (むら) on the side of it. The mural is of the forest where they got the tree from so they remember the building's origins.,Look at the mural on the side of this newly constructed village center. So many trees! Visualize the whole process as the tree becomes a building as you gaze and reflect on the message of the mural.,kanji level4
年,year,ねん,とし,牛,"Cow, Gun","The cow part of this kanji is slightly altered, but I think you can see where it is. The gun looks just fine, though. Think back to a fake memory you have living on the farm. You have your gun, and you gotta use it on a cow (ruh roh). Once a year on New Year's, you have to go out and shoot one of the cows. It's only a yearly shooting, though, so at least there's that respite.",You'll have to imagine yourself doing this to remember the meaning of the kanji. Focus on the thought that 'okay... it's only once a year... I only have to do this once a year...',"It is New Years, though, so when you bring the dead cow back home, it’s time to celebrate. Using the cow’s organs and bones, you and your siblings construct a nendoroid (ねん). Nendoroids are Japanese toys - little plastic figurines (Google it if need be). You make a little cow nendoroid holding a gun. How cute.",How funny that you use dead cow parts to make a miniature cow holding a gun much like the one you murdered earlier. Imagine yourself playing with this nendoroid as you think about how weird it was to make a cow nendoroid out of a dead cow.,kanji level4
角,angle,かく,かど,"勹, 用","Enclosure, Elephant","You have an enclosure trying to enclose the elephant. But, as you can see already, the elephant is way too big for it.

A 60 degree angle. A 20 degree angle... nothing works - no matter what angle you turn it at, the elephant won't fit in.","You finally figure out the right angle to get the elephant into the enclosure. Wow, this is great! But, the moment you start squeezing it in, you hear a big squawk. The enclosure is already filled with cocks (かく), and they're all flying around fighting with each other, and scratching the elephant too.","This causes the elephant to freak out, destroying the enclosure in the process. Thousands of these roosters (cocks) stream out and fly everywhere, darkening the sky with how many there are.",kanji level5
青,blue,"せい, しょう",あお,青,Blue,The blue radical and the blue kanji are exactly the same.,"Don't feel blue, you should know this kanji automagically!","When we need to remember the on'yomi せい we think of Hard Gay (because he says ""sei sei sei."" When we need to remember the on'yomi しょう we think of a shogun. Remembering both of these readings is the real challenge here! Start by thinking of something that's very blue. What's the bluest thing you can think of? For me, it's the Blue Man Group. Imagine the Blue Man Group, but instead of the regular members, you have Hard Gay (sei) and a Shogun (shou), both painted from head to toe in blue paint. They are playing for you an amazing concert. It's fantastic! It's blue!","You'll want to imagine Hard Gay and the Shogun doing things that you would imagine them to do. Something crazy, something wild, and something memorable.

Is he a fake?,"Just imagine finding your leader's body somewhere, even though you saw him just a moment before in the other room. That means the other one is a fake, and this body is the real leader.","How do you know this is the real leader's body though, and not someone else's body? Because the real leader always would wear a tie (たい) with monkeys on it, and this body has a tie with monkeys on it. Now you know the facts.","Spend some time analyzing the situation. You're a detective here. The telling item is the tie, so focus in on that as grounds for knowing.",kanji level5
色,color,"いろ　(しき, しょく)",いろ,色,Color,The color radical and color are the same in looks as well as and meaning.,Color me pink!

They're obviously responsible for all these pelican graves.","What a terrible company, though. Just think about all the companies you don't like, and add them to your metaphorical list.",To remember the reading しゃ we use the word 'shaman'. The company hired a shaman (しゃ) to help them kill all the pelicans. The shaman does a shaman ritual that lulls the pelicans into a false sense of security and then the company kills them.,Imagine you're one of the people working at the company.

You basically have yourself a forest!,Follow the logic of this one and you should be okay.,"So, now you have this forest and you want to cut it down (so much money!).

When you need to remember く we use 'cooties.' When you need to remember さ we use 'saw.' So, くさ is a 'cooties saw.' You have plenty of grass in front of you, but you want to get rid of it. You take your cooties saw (くさ), which is a saw made out of cooties, and cut out a huge chunk of the grass and tear it up so that you can replant and get those flowers back again.",The reason you're using a cooties saw is because it actually eats up the grass (because it's made up of a million little bugs) - that way there isn't a big pile of grass to throw away afterwards.,kanji level5
里,home village,さと (り),さと,里,Sunflower,"Turns out, your home village is known for all its beautiful sunflowers.","You might have to make up this part of your past, but the village you were born in is just beautiful during the summer.

多,many,た,おお,夕,Evening,How many evenings are there? There are many.,"If you accidentally think 'a lot' or something similar, that's okay too. It's the basic meaning that counts, and all these things are pretty close, though eventually you want to get to the point where you know that this kanji does in fact mean many.","To remember the reading た we use the word 'Taco' Let's start with the kanji meaning: many. You go outside in the evening (because that's what this kanji is made up of) and are surprised when you're hit by many tacos flying from the sky.

You had two hat piles meeting each other. You think it'll be love. Finally, the date is set, and they are about to meet for the first time. You have a good feeling about this. Just as they begin to meet each other, things are looking good... until a coyote (かい) jumps out from nowhere, grabs one of the hat piles, shakes it around, then runs off with it.","This is a disaster. This meet was your idea, and now you've gotten a pile of hats killed. How terrible. You probably shouldn't have chosen to let them meet in a coyote sanctuary.",kanji level5
交,mix,こう,"まじ, ま, か","亠, 父","Lid, Father","Your father is in a kettle with a lid on top. This is a horrible situation. To make things worse, someone is forcing you to mix him with a big spoon. As you mix him, he tells you to mix harder, so that at least your life can be saved. 'Mix me, child! Mix me!!'","Imagine yourself having to mix your father in a kettle, then put the lid on. This is a terrible thing... but also a terrible thing you'll probably remember, helping you to remember the kanji's meaning as well.","Just before your father dies from you mixing him in a pot of boiling water, he has to tell you something. 'I'm not your father! Your father is... こういち!","Oh my God! Quite the bomb. Feel the shock, anger, and then forgiveness. You killed the person who you thought was your father because crazy people made you do it... but then you find out that こういち is your real father?? Such a mix of emotions to draw on to remember this reading! Think on this a bit. What will your next actions be? Will you seek out your real father?",kanji level5
近,near,"きん, こん",ちか,斤,"Axe, Water Slide",The water slide with axes flowing down it instead of water is near your house!,"Imagine it right next to your house. People are lining up to use it, but to you it's just an eyesore because you have to look at the dumb thing everyday. It's so near, too! Literally the next lot over.","The problem with how near the axe water slide is to your home is that your kin (きん) are always wanting to come over to your house so they can go ride it - they don't actually want to see you, they just want to ride the awesome axe water slide.","Imagine your 'kin' as a bunch of stereotypical hillbillies. At least, that's what I think when I think of the word 'kin.'",kanji level5
池,pond,いけ (ち),いけ,也,"Alligator, Tsunami","The poor alligator was taken far inland by a tsunami. His only source of water is a tiny pond that barely fits his body, and doesn't even provide much food.","Imagine the alligator riding the tsunami in. When he hits the ground, and the water recedes, he's all alone in a field. He doesn't like it... it's not his environment. So, he looks around and finally finds a little pond, but it doesn't provide much for him. Imagine him looking for food in the little, shallow pond. Imagine him trying to stay wet... it's just not a great situation to be in, unfortunately.","Eventually, the alligator dies. You come upon it and think it's alive. You shriek 'EEEEK!' (いけ) when you see it.",Actually scream 'EEEK' wherever you are as you imagine yourself coming across this alligator. Then think about how weird it was that you screamed 'EEEK.' Be sure to feel the surprise and fear from seeing the alligator as well.,kanji level5
雨,rain,あめ　(う),"あめ, あま",雨,Rain,The radical for rain and the kanji for rain are the same thing.,Make sure you know your radicals!,"What if the rain actually tried to aim (あめ) for you? As in, drops would move out of their normal flight path just to hit you on your head? You'd be a lot wetter, that's for sure.","Imagine a world where each rain drop had to choose a target to aim for. How strange would rainfall be? Also, あめ and 'aim' don't really sound too much alike, but the goal is to use 'aim' to get to あめ, so make sure to take note of that in your mind as you learn the reading.",kanji level5
米,rice,"べい, まい",こめ,米,Rice,"The rice radical and rice are the same in looks as well as and meaning. This also refers to 'America,' maybe because America is covered in rice or fields or something?",Aren't radicals nice? They make things so much easier... if you've been studying them.,"You've got tons of dry grains of rice. You have no idea what you're going to do with it. Then, you come up with a solution. All this dry rice could go towards filling up the bay (べい), so you have more land to farm on!","In your mind, bulldoze the rice into the bay, watching it fill it up, then pile high. It's not particularly good looking land, but it'll do, and it's already full of seeds, so that's pretty good. The important thing is that you think you have way too much of the stuff, so the only way to get rid of it is to dump it in a large body of water, and that large body of water is a bay.",kanji level5
当,"right, success",とう,あ,ヨ,"Wolverine, Triceratops","The 'right' for this kanji is like 'correct' or something along those lines. It's like when you get a question correct. 'You're Right!' You could also say it's a success. There's a triceratops and a wolverine. What are they doing together? You'd think they'd fight, but they took their battle to another venue... they're competing in Jeopardy! One of them answers a question, and the host says 'You're right!'","Feel free to think through several questions and answers, but make sure they're all right, because that's what we're focusing on. Also make sure to focus on the triceratops and the wolverine themselves. You want to make sure that when you see these two radicals you automatically know they're playing Jeopardy, not doing anything else, like fighting or racing or playing or something.","When we need to remember the reading とう, we use the Japanese city, Tokyo. The last question in the Jeopardy match is the following: 'The capital of Japan.' The triceratops answers first. 'What is... Tokyo (とう)?' Right again!",What a ridiculously easy question to ask. Think of it from the poor wolverine's perspective... he could have won if he had hit the buzzer more quickly. Ugh!,kanji level5
走,run,そう,はし,走,Run,The radical run and the kanji run are exactly the same!,Make sure you know those radicals!,"To remember the reading そう we use the word 'sew.' You're running and running and running. You can't stop. In fact, you run so hard, your leg just falls clean off from overuse. You stop and grab it, then try to sew (そう) it back on again.","Of course, imagine yourself sewing on your leg. How much would it hurt? Would it stay on or be floppy? Maybe if you used a sewing machine?",kanji level5
同,same,どう,おな,一,"Ground, Mustache","There's a mustache on the ground. Upon closer inspection, you see that the mustache on the ground is exactly the same as yours!","Pick up the mustache, hold it up next to your face in front of a mirror. It's unbelievable, but it's the same in every way, down to the last hair.","When we need to remember the reading どう, we use the word 'doughnut'. While this is already strange enough, you notice something stranger. Over a couple feet away is a doughnut (どう) who also has the same mustache as you (and the one that fell on the ground). The doughnut looks at you for a moment, then scampers off. This doughnut must be a mutant because normally doughnuts don't move.","If it helps, imagine hundreds or thousands of doughnuts all around you with the same exact mustache. First of all, it's terrifying to be surrounded by thousands of mutant doughnuts. Secondly, it's really weird they all have the same mustache as you.",kanji level5
言,say,"げん, ごん","い, こと",言,Say,The radical say is the same as the kanji say!,"If, say, you learn your radicals, you'll know a lot of your kanji as well!",I want you to say this out loud. Really say it. What generation are you from? Gen Y? Gen X? Please say it out loud.,"You'll have to really focus in on this set of requests and connect them to the meaning of this kanji. Meaning of the kanji is easy to get to, but connecting it to remember the reading is a little more difficult. Spend a little time thinking about how they relate before moving on.",kanji level5
自,self,"じ, し",-,自,Self,The self radical and self are the same in looks as well as and meaning.,Radicals have self. Kanji has self. Kanji and radicals can sometimes be the same thing... so do they really have 'self'? Only way to find out is to study both of them hard!,"When we need to remember じ we use the word 'Jesus.' Who said you should always look at your self before tossing stones (or whatever) at others? Jesus (じ) did. So, make sure you look at your own self before being a jerk.",You can feel free to do some introspection here.,kanji level5
売,sell,う (ばい),う,"儿, 冖, 士","Legs, Forehead, Samurai","There’s a samurai with (just) his forehead and legs. Everything in between is missing. What happened to everything in between? He was low on money, so he had to sell it all, leaving him only the top and the bottom.","Imagine this terrifying samurai. You have legs… okay, that’s normal. But, then you have just a giant forehead on the top of everything else, walking around. That’s pretty scary that someone would sell such important parts of their body.","To remember the reading う we use the word うに (sea urchin). After he’s sold half of his body, the Samurai starts trying to sell uni (う) as well. He keeps pushing the uni at you, trying to get you to buy it.","It’s up to you what you imagine after this (whether you buy it or not). Maybe you can take and sample some of it first (and taste the uni). Whatever you do, come up with a continuation for this story, and be sure to imagine the samurai as only a forehead on top of some legs. What is he talking out of? Why is he selling uni?",kanji level5

It's totally covered in hair which is arranged in a very strange shape.,"I want you to come up with a really strange shape this hair lantern should be in.

It turns out the KKK (けい) have been here, and they left their sign (a big ""K"") on the lantern.

空,sky,くう,"そら, から, あ","工, 儿, 宀","Construction, Legs, Helmet","You're doing some construction under your legs, and you're even wearing a helmet on top of that. Why do you need to build something under you and put something on top of you? You want to be able to reach the sky.",So that explains why you're doing so many things to make yourself taller... too bad the sky is really high. Imagine what you'd need to construct / wear to get up that high.,"To remember the reading くう we'll use the word 'cooties.' You finally make yourself taller. But once you reach the sky, you find it's full of nasty cooties (くう) that knock you over and make you fall down.","You'll have to come up with something interesting for cooties in terms of what they look like. Are they like small bugs to you? Millions of small bugs running into you while you're up in the sky, knocking you down?",kanji level5
音,sound,おん,"おと, ね","日, 立","Sun, Stand","For some reason, you are standing on the sun. It's obviously very hot, but the thing you notice most is the sound of you burning up. It sizzles so much.","Imagine a super loud sizzling sound, drowning everything else out. It's ridiculously loud, and hurts your ears more than the sun's heat hurts your skin.","This sound is ridiculously loud. To counteract this, you turn on (おん) your noise canceling headphones.","You could turn on many other things too, to help out... maybe a fan to cool you off. Maybe the AC. Think of a bunch of things you turn on, and imagine yourself switching the 'on' switch to 'on' as well, to help bring home the point.",kanji level5
学,study,がく,まな,子,"Child, Viking","You have a wild viking child you have to take care of. He won't do anything but study, surprisingly. You can't get him to eat, use the bathroom, or anything else. He just wants to study.","Of course, this isn't what you'd expect of a little viking child. It's the opposite. That's why it's so surprising! He loves to study!",This crazy viking child who prefers study over pillaging (and other viking activities)... the other vikings just stop and gawk (がく) at him when they walk by.,You should tell the other vikings to stop gawking at this child. Just because he likes to study doesn't mean he's a bad viking...,kanji level5
光,"sunlight, light",こう,"ひかり, ひか",,"Triceratops, Pi","You see a triceratops in the distance... but notice something odd about it. It's perfectly pi shaped (circular) It's the pitriceratops! But the shape isn't the strange thing about the pitriceratops. The weird part is that these creatures are made 100% out of sunlight. This kanji can also simply just mean light as well, if you like.","Imagine it absorbing sunlight to become stronger. Then, it turns and sees you, nearly blinding you. Feel the pain in your eyes from all the sunlight emanating off the pitriceratops.","Then you see it's actually fighting someone (that's what pitriceratops do best). He's fighting こういち, shooting him with bolts of sunlight, melting him where he stands.",Imagine this sight and make it somewhat traumatic.

考,think,かんが　(こう),かんが,,"Beggar, Coffin","We have a coffin and a beggar. How do these things go together? The person begging is in the coffin. He's begging for his life, of course, but that's not going to do him any good. So, after he realizes that, he just begins to think. What could I have done better in my life? Why am I in this situation? How will I get out? Think, damnit, think!!","Imagine him going down the slide thinking really, really hard. Maybe his head begins visibly throbbing from all of it. His hands are on his chin, allowing him to contemplate harder. Important thing is to focus in on the beggar’s thinking and perhaps a bit about what he’s thinking of.","As he's being lowered into the grave in his coffin, conga (かんが) music begins to play. It interrupts his thinking, and he's unable to think clearly anymore.","Imagine his frustration (or, imagine it's you and your thinking is getting interrupted). This conga music is really irritating.",kanji level5
回,"times, revolve",かい,まわ,口,Mouth,"There's a mouth inside a mouth. But, if you look even closer (not actually, but we're pretending) you can see another mouth inside that mouth... and another one inside of that one! It keeps going and going. Can you count the number of times there's a mouth inside a mouth? This kanji also means revolve, too. Think of each 'time' a thing happens, it loops back around and comes back to the beginning, revolving around again for another time.","Imagine yourself counting and counting smaller and smaller mouths inside of each other, recording the number of times you can find a mouth inside another mouth. Dig deeper and deeper until it feels ridiculous how small the mouths are getting. Be sure to focus on the counting and the number of times you find one. Now, how many mouths is this times two, because your mouth is like this too.","When we need to remember the reading かい we use the word 'coyote' At the very end... at the very last mouth... there's a big surprise for you there, which causes you to fall back. There's a tiny coyote (かい) that jumps out of the tiny little mouth and then gets bigger as it flies out at you, grabbing onto your face.","During all this, do you remember the number of times you had to count mouths in order to get to the coyote? Also, don't forget to feel surprised by the coyote jumping out at you. That surprise will help you to remember the reading!",kanji level5
谷,valley,たに (こく),たに,"ハ, 口","Fins, Mouth, Hat","There's a hat decorated with fins and (presumably fish) mouths on it. Who wears strange hats like this?

Fins and fish mouths... what a strange new fad.,"Hanging around with all the Valley Girls in the sunny area of LA is also a robot. It's WALL-E's distant (and lazy, lounging relative), TAN-E (たに).

He's the epitome of robot laziness.,kanji level5
声,voice,こえ　(せい),こえ,"尸, 士","Flag, Samurai, Stick","You have a samurai with a flag on a stick. On his flag is this symbol, the kanji for voice. Why does he have that there?

It's already pretty odd, thinking of a guy standing on a country on a globe, not to mention a weird guy like the character Hard Gay, but the stranger you make it in your mind, the more likely you are to remember it later!",kanji level5
何,what,なに (か),"なに, なん","ｲ, 可","Leader, Lip Ring","Our leader has a lip ring. Wait, our leader has a lip ring?

You want to have the feeling of 'what' in you when you imagine this - that'll help you to remember this kanji's meaning.","The leader with his lip ring is now eating some nan (なん) and curry. It's delicious, of course... but then he gets it caught on his lip ring, and tears half his lip off. He screams: 'Nannnnn eeeeeeeeeehhh!!' (なに) in anger at the nan and curry.","Make this one vivid and scary. He's eating the nan (that's your なん), and then he screams at the nan but gets overwhelmed with pain (that's the なに).

麦,wheat,むぎ　(ばく),むぎ,"生, 夂","Life, Winter","The life radical is without the slide (as it sometimes is), but when you combine that with the winter you have life during winter.

I'd say someone who's an immature boy. That would be your younger brother.","Just pretend you have a younger brother for now, if you don't. Also be sure to imagine this person really vividly. They look ridiculous. He is a stereotypical little kid (horns because horns are awesome, springs on his feet, and a stick - plus he's going down a slide). Everything about someone like this screams 'little brother.'","Unfortunately he goes down this slide too fast, bounces off the bottom with his spring shoes, and then falls right on his stick. It goes through him, causing your younger brother to die (だい). That's right, he's dead (で) now.","Be sure to feel bad about your younger brother.

It's so cold that your poop freezes to your butt cheeks and loiters there for a long time.

So, you're stuck with it behind you until you can get home.","To pass the time while you wait for your poop to thaw from your rear/behind/back, you play a rousing game of go (ご) with your good pal こういち.

The perfect mix of ketchup and catsup! The radical is technically blood, but you know that radical is just a drop (of blood) on a plate. So, you ask yourself... Is that really blood on the plate? Could it be? You decide to take a gamble and lick it off. When you taste it, it's definitely not blood. No, it's ketsup (けつ).","Feel the relief that you didn't just lick up someone's blood.

両,both,りょう,-,"一, 山, 冂","Ground, Mountain, Head","Under the ground, which you dug into, you found two great finds. You found both a mountain and a head, two strange things to find underground.","You'll want to focus on the part where you find both, not so much the things themselves.

Imagine them at the capital (imagine your capital building, whatever it is, in your country). P.S. This kanji looks very similar to the radical 束 but it's a little different. The line doesn't cross through the middle all the way. Be careful of this.","To remember the reading きょう we use the Japanese city, Kyoto. Remember how there's a revolution brewing in the capital (via the radical?). It is drawing near. The people will take the capital soon. They've already taken Kyoto (きょう), and they took it with ease.

Imagine this scene as a drawing to hit home the point that this kanji means drawing as well.","Now you get it! Someone created this rice paddy in this box. The drawing is trying to depict a god (が) that is creating the earth. It's like his little sandbox for creation experiments.

Eventually you find yourself in Tokyo (とう), which is about as far east as you can get. Once in Tokyo, you reach into the water and pull out some fish fins.","Feel these scaly, webbed fins in your hands. You're very tired from walking all the way to Tokyo, but these fins were worth it.

食,"eat, meal",しょく,"た, く",食,Eat,The radical for eat and the kanji for eat are the same! Lucky you.,"If you know the radical, you basically know the meaning(s) of this kanji. There is a second meaning added to it, though, and that is meal. Just think about the things you eat? What are they? In the simplest form, they are just meals. So, if you know 'eat' you should be able to remember 'meal' as well.","Thank goodness, you finally get to eat your meal. You're so hungry. Someone has been starving you and now they've finally given you food. Unfortunately, though, every time you take a bite, you get a shock (しょく) from somewhere.","So, do you keep eating and keep getting shocked? Or do you not eat and continue to starve? What is worse?

Maybe if you build a time machine you can go back and stop yourself from throwing your cross around so carelessly. Whatever you do, focus on how important it is to fix the mistake, more than anything. This kanji also means direct, so just imagine Mike Tyson being very direct when he speaks to you.","Of course, there's not much you can do to fix this issue, and eventually Tyson finds out. In his rage, he grabs you around the neck and chokes (ちょく) you. As he rattles you, you make a 'jikijikijiki' (じき) noise as well. How's that for taking the direct approach?","Imagine Tyson grabbing your neck choking you out. You can't breath. You stop struggling. Then everything goes black.

No matter what, these objects are always in front.","You're going crazy with these things in front of you all the time.

氏,family name,し,うじ,氏,Duck,"The only radical that makes up this kanji is duck.

This goes on and on, and as it goes on, make sure to focus in on the fault part, with both people blaming each other over and over.","Remember the dog that got squished? The husband was really sad about this, because it turned out to really be his fault because he built the slide too, so to make it up to the kids, he buys a new puppy.

Don't you want to be part of a cool group like that? Your own top hat team.,"Even though the thread is connecting your top hats, the group itself is just so-so (そ).

Then, imagine the relief and surprise as she just passes right through the elephant, barely slowing down.

間,interval,"かん, けん","あいだ, ま","日, 門","Sun, Gate","Think of a gate that the sun has to go through every time it revolves around in the sky (I know, the sun doesn't move, but let's pretend it's ancient China, okay?). Someone at the gate checks the time, and makes sure the interval is correct, then waves it through the gate for another circling, where it creates its next interval of time.","Interval is a weird word to remember, but just think of the sun going around the earth and through the gate just like clockwork. Every 24 hours it passes through the gate, and each interval is exactly the same.","The interval is perfect... at least, until now. Genghis Khan and his Mongol horde come down on the gate and destroy it, delaying the sun by several hours. Now the interval is all messed up due to the Khans. Time to build a great wall, or something, to protect.","It's not too out there to assume a Khan attacked something Chinese (remember, we're pretending this interval sun gate is Chinese!). That's what Genghis, Kublai, and all the other Khans were known for, after all - attacks on China!",kanji level8
場,location,ば (じょう),ば,"土, 易","Grave, Gravity",There is a great gravity at this grave. It pulls us in towards it... It obviously wants us to go to a specific location (aka the location where it is).,"This is a really, really general kanji meaning which makes it harder to remember via a mnemonic. Spend a few extra seconds trying to sort this one out in your head before moving on.",The location you're being pulled towards is the secret sheep graveyard. You can hear the 'Baa (ば) baa baaaaaa!' noises more clearly the closer you get. It's scary!,"The reading for this kanji is actually quite difficult to pinpoint. It uses both on'yomi and kun'yomi readings quite often, and there's no real good rules to figure out when to do which. The kun'yomi reading seems slightly more common, though, which is why we're going with that one. You will, however, have to work a little bit when you get to this kanji's vocab. Just a warning!",kanji level8
医,medicine,い,-,"矢, 匚","Arrow, Cage",You're in a cage and you've been shot by an arrow. Obviously things are looking pretty bad. You need some medicine if you hope to live.,"More specifically, antibiotics. Your wound is festering pretty badly.","When we need to remember the sound い we use the word 'Eagle.' You need your medicine really bad. Then, you look up. There's an eagle flying overhead. He has a package. It's medicine! You're saved!","Or, so you think. He just keeps circling and circling. Feel some hate for the eagle. Why isn't he dropping the medicine? You don't have long to live!",kanji level8
朝,morning,あさ (ちょう),あさ,"十, 日, 月","Cross, Sun, Moon","There's a cross on both sides of the sun, with the moon off to one side. That's because the religious folk are all about the morning (all those early church sessions!), and everyone else is all about the night (the moon).",Just think about religious people waking up super early to do their rituals. That's why the crosses are on the sun. That's why they're associated with the morning.,"But, they're kind of grumpy because they have to wake up early in the morning. So, they're constantly cutting each other off, pushing each other, and being jerks. Imagine all of these people yelling back and forth at each other: 'You ass!' (あさ) a ridiculous amount, then all suddenly becoming quiet when they sit down in the church.","It might help if you think about them all being Italian too. At least when it comes to a stereotypical Italian accent, they'd say something like 'you ass-a hole-a!' If you're Italian, this is probably absolutely how you don't sound.",kanji level8
番,number in a series,ばん,-,"田, 釆","Rice Paddy, Sickle","You have to sickle the rice paddy today because it's your turn. This kanji also means number in a series, which is a lot like a turn. For example, you're number 3, so your turn will be number 3.","Go through in your mind the system your farm / village uses for deciding who has to sickle on any given day. It rotates, and it's a turn-based system. So, do you all stand in a line? Is there a calendar? Come up with something interesting, focusing on your turn in the process you come up with. It will be helpful to remember both the 'number in a series' and 'turn' meanings for the vocab coming up in the future.","This turn-based rice sickle system is a contest as well! But, you are disappointed to find out that you have been banned from the game because of the performance enhancing steroids you've been taking.","Try to feel disappointed by this.

It shoots you out onto pavement where you keep on sliding, except now you're surrounded by terrifying trucks and vehicles. You slide around, avoiding getting hit. It's so strange that you're even on a road in the first place, actually.","To remember the reading どう we use the word 'doughnut'. You're going so fast on this road that you don't see the giant doughnut (どう) until the last minute. You crash into it, and both you and the doughnut go tumbling down.","Be sure to feel the last minute panic as you see the giant doughnut in the middle of the road. How did it get here?

Make the focus of this imaginary review be about the terrible service. Go ahead and make up your own story about how bad the service was, too.","Why are you getting such bad service from people who supposedly have great service as their duty? It turns out the employees are all standing around just going 'yak (やく) yak yak yak yak' (that's the sound of people talking, by the way).",Go ahead and mock these employees by saying 'yak yak yak' over their talking. Feel a bit upset about this as well.,kanji level8

Several giant ken (けん) dolls.","Imagine yourself doing battle with these human-sized dolls. They're quite good at fighting, despite being made out of plastic. What gives?",kanji level8
身,somebody,しん,み,"丿, 自","Slide, Self","The self radical is a bit modified, with things sticking out, but that’s because it’s falling down a slide. Sure, it’s yourself who’s tumbling down the slide… at least that’s how it feels to you. Who are you? What are you? All you know is you’re somebody, but you don’t know who that somebody is.","Apparently, you’re having some kind of internal crisis. Come up with a rough one and you’ll remember this kanji better.","You’re falling down this metaphorical slide… And then you hit something… and you hit it really hard.

者,someone,しゃ,もの,日,"Sun, Coffin","A coffin has been left out in the sun for too long. When dead bodies are out in the sun like this, they really begin to decompose. You are wondering who this person is, though. You can't tell because it's fallen apart too much. You look on the coffin. There's a label, but it only says 'someone.'","Smell the stench of the decomposing body. Also, feel really curious as to who this person is. It came from somewhere that gives you a reason to believe it's someone you know. Then, feel the disappointment as you read the label that says 'someone' instead of an actual name. 'Someone,' you repeat. 'Someone.'","To remember the sound しゃ we use 'shaman.' It's time you open the coffin and check. Maybe there's more answers in there. There's no way this person could just be 'someone.' You lift the lid, and sure enough, you're able to figure out who it is. It's a shaman (しゃ), dressed in full shaman garb.","How strange that a shaman was delivered to you this way!

合,suit,"あ、あい (ごう, がっ)","あ, あい",合,Suit,"The radical suit and the kanji suit are exactly the same! This kanji can also mean join which makes sense. When something suits you well, like a hat or something, it joins together with you quite well too. Join me, my hat! You suit my head well. It just fits, you know?","Just remember that this 'suit' means 'to suit you' - not the thing you wear, okay!","You wear the hat you found out around the town (remember the strange hat with a mouth on it from when you learned the radical 合?).

So, you know, there's that at least.",Imagine little あ characters coming out of their mouths while they scream to hit home the point that they're screaming あ and not something else. But あい am there too. あい think you look great.,kanji level8
支,support,し,ささ.える,支,Frog,"The hard part about learning this kanji is that the radical looks the same but doesn't have the same meaning. So, let's make a story. The frog was all alone (just like in this kanji). Nobody else was there to help him. He had to support the weight of the building to make sure it didn't fall on the elementary school.",When you think 'frog' you have to automatically think about this story. Embellish and add to it if you want. Make it more ridiculous. Make it more vivid. Whatever you need to do to remember that Frog = support.,"To remember the reading し, we use the name Charlie 'Sheen.' - Remember the frog from when you learned that this kanji means support?
